	Why Jorn Barger is wrong and the rest of the world is right
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">December  7, 2007</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>So, as I was browsing the web for a topic for this week's blog post, I came across an article in Wired that really caught my eye. In it, the inventor of blogging, Jorn Barger, talks about <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2007/12/blog_advice">what blogging should have been</a> instead of what it has become. He seems to be of the impression that blogs should be, essentially, reports of interesting links the blogger has seen recently. Sorry Jorn, but that's what del.icio.us and digg are for now. Blogs these days frequently come in two flavors - personal diaries and explorations of a particular topic. While links play a major role in most of the latter, they are often completely absent in the former. Blogging has gone beyond its humble origins and developed into something akin to a cross between 18th century coffee houses and digital soap boxes. Blogging is a powerful social medium. It can be a tremendous platform for conversation on just about any topic. My personal favorites, like productivity, fun, and fitness, have endless possibilities for debate, ideas, and plain craziness. It wouldn't be nearly as much fun, though, without the highly social nature of it all. A conversation isn't a conversation if it's a bunch of links.</p>
