	Wellness challenge for November 2023
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">October 31, 2023</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>Last month, I went over my goals for this year to remind myself what they were and see how I'm doing.
It was an unpleasant surprise; I'd failed to do any of them. Then, earlier this month, I read Arnold
Schwarzenegger's &quot;Be Useful&quot; book. His stories about growing up and getting into bodybuilding made my
brain start working.</p>
<p>After a few days of reflection, I decided to do a wellness challenge for myself over the course of November.
There are two components to this challenge:</p>
<ol>
<li>No alcohol</li>
<li>Gym workouts at least four days a week</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal with the first is to eliminate a source of empty calories and to give my body a break from
the toxic effects.</p>
<p>The goal with the second is threefold - first, to establish a gym habit; second, to lose useless weight; and third,
to try out bodybuilding as a hobby.</p>
<p>Giving up alcohol is not new to me. I gave it up for two months last November. I felt pretty great even just a couple
weeks into it, so I'm looking forward to this.</p>
<p>For the workouts, I intend to go in the mornings before work. The gym that I go to is empty then, and it might
be a good wake-up routine. I've chosen <a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/start-from-scratch-beginner-workout">this workout plan</a>
from Muscle and Strength. The first couple weeks use this schedule:</p>
<ol>
<li>Squats, 2 sets, 12 reps</li>
<li>Leg curls, 1 set, 12 reps</li>
<li>Calf raises, 2 sets, 12 reps</li>
<li>Bench press, 2 sets, 12 reps</li>
<li>Pulldowns, 2 sets, 12 reps</li>
<li>Cable rows, 2 sets, 12 reps</li>
<li>Overhead press, 2 sets, 12 reps</li>
</ol>
<p>Tomorrow morning I'll need to figure out what weight I should be using for each. I will be logging my workouts so
I can figure out how I'm doing over time. I know how to do all of the above exercises except for the overhead press,
so I'll need to make sure I get the proper form for that one before I really push it.</p>
