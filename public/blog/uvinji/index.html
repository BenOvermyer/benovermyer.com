	Uvinji
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">November  3, 2020</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>As soon as the pre-expansion patch launched, I fired up World of Warcraft with the intent to create my new main character and begin my adventure anew.</p>
<p>Well, that first night there was a bit of a hiccup, as everyone else had the same idea. It took a lot longer to unlock the Vulpera allied race than I thought it would, as there was a quest chain for me to complete and it was very buggy. On top of that, I kept getting logged out. Eventually, I gave up for the night and logged back in the next day. Everything went smoothly after that.</p>
<p>I created Uvinji, my Vulpera Shaman, and logged in. I expected to start at the new new-player island, but instead it started me off at level 10 and skipped all of that. I was a little disappointed, but oh well.</p>
<p>After a little bit of running around Orgrimmar, I went on my way to Northrend to do the Wrath of the Lich King content. It was fun, at first, especially because I started in an area that I'd never actually done before. I made my way through all the quests in the Borean Tundra and ended up in Dragonblight.</p>
<p>At this point, I'd leveled up to 31. With the level cap being 50 now, that was quite a bit of progress. However, at this point, I got bored of the grind. The content was familiar, and honestly, I hate the Scourge and all of the undead-filled areas. They're very monotone in color and boring to level through. So, I used my one-time Shadowlands level-up-to-50 token on Uvinji to power him all the way up, and went through the &quot;you're a brand new 50&quot; tutorial.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to the pre-expansion event that starts next Tuesday. Here's hoping it's more exciting than the last time the Scourge event happened...</p>
