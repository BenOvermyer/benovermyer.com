	The Imperial March
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">February 12, 2008</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>I resubbed to Star Wars Galaxies despite discovering the announcement that no further expansions will be produced for it, and despite the gnawing suspicion I have that Bioware and LucasArts are producing a SWG-killer.</p>
<p>The reason is the Imperial Army.</p>
<p>This player association has made its home on Chilastra for as long as SWG has existed. They're a great group of people, and I first joined up with them in 2004. I've been forced to take extended hiatuses from SWG for various reasons, but I was always welcomed back into the fold whenever I returned.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to SWG because of the community. It's a dedicated group of honest, hardworking, and genuinely fun people….and not just the IA, though they're obviously at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>So then, I'm back. And now, my plans for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Major Goal #1:</strong> Hit CL90 with Scin. I'm halfway to 88 right now, which is a major milestone. I'll finally be able to wield the lava cannon and hence become roughly on par with the 90-level PvPers. Up to now, I've been relegated mostly to lighting people on fire in PvP and hoping someone else finishes them off before they get me. Hitting CL90 will be the final culmination of a very long and occasionally tedious journey with Scin. Whether I stay Commando or not will depend on how much fun I have as a CL90.</p>
<p><strong>Major Goal #2:</strong> Acquire a Vigo. The privateer gunship is a very cool-looking boat from the outside, and as a master pilot, it's both a duty and a desire to acquire the most powerful weapon in the privateer arsenal. I intend to make my Vigo into one of the “main characters” in Scin's backstory, and appropriately deck it out with Imperial decorations. Though I'm a privateer, I still need and want to show solidarity with the Empire.</p>
<p><strong>Major Goal #3:</strong> Establish Scin as a core part of the newly organized space wing of the Imperial Army. It's time to really build the space wing, especially since it is so new, and if I can drive increasingly better performance in space battles I will consider this goal met. It's a tall order, though, as reliant on teamwork as it is. Since Scin is a privateer, he will only be able to act as a crewman on gunships or Decimators in PvP.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Goal #1:</strong> Finish the Rare Weapons Collections. I'm intrigued by them after finding one of the rifle parts behind the Storm Lord's throne. I want to acquire these badges and see what comes of it.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Goal #2:</strong> Turn Fuura Hengwen into what Scin used to be - a one-man starship engineering company. Though I don't relish the idea of factory-style production, artisan-style might suit me better. It has in the past.</p>
