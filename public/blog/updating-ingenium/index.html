	Updating Ingenium: Dusting off the manuscript
</h1>

<div class="blog-content">
<p>Silver Gryphon Games shut its doors in 2019. This meant that the second edition of my Ingenium role-playing game was mothballed and it would never see the light of day.</p>
<p>Or so I thought.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2021. Earlier this month I cloned the manuscript git repository for the second edition and started digging through it, just for nostalgia's sake. Then I started noticing little corrections I could make. I began writing these up as issues in GitLab for the manuscript's repository. After not too long, I started working on it again.</p>
<p>First, I rewrote the whole manuscript from LaTeX-enhanced Markdown to full LaTeX. I then ported the layout definitions from my Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire project to Ingenium. That all took several hours. Once it was done, then I started hacking on the text itself.</p>
<p>Time has not been kind to the manuscript. Since I last touched it in 2014, the world has changed. While the system itself was mostly fine, some of the world description was problematic, and &quot;races&quot; as a mechanic have really fallen out of favor. One of the first changes I made was to replace the original &quot;races&quot; with &quot;species,&quot; and then began to rewrite all of the species descriptions to remove anything that implied that species defined culture and behavior.</p>
<p>I also reworked several parts of the world description and made note of a large number of sections that just felt rough or awkward. After that, I changed the &quot;Monsters &amp; Challenges&quot; chapter into two chapters - Adversaries &amp; Allies and Bestiary. I moved all of the sentient &quot;monsters&quot; into Adversaries &amp; Allies as non-player races and reworked their descriptions to no longer make them monotone. For example, goblins are no longer uniformly evil thieves, and don't have a single culture. All of the non-sentient &quot;monsters&quot; I changed into entries in the Bestiary chapter and began fleshing them out more as inhabitants of the world and not just things to kill.</p>
<p>I also removed the experience point reward for killing things. In its place is just a reward for overcoming challenges, which de-emphasizes killing enemies in favor of finding ways to help allies. The system needs more work, but I plan on adding even more emphasis on the player characters as social members of the world, and not just murderhobo tomb raiders.</p>
<p>The world of Eiridia itself needs a lot of fleshing out. What's written already is a decent start, but it's mostly historical information about how each country came to be. I want to add more accessible information to the setting chapters so that players can understand how the various cultures behave, and how their own characters might behave within Eiridia. I also want to write more about how to build interesting stories in the context of Eiridia and how the player characters fit into that world.</p>
<p>None of this means that Silver Gryphon Games is coming back from the dead. Kevin and I have discussed that possibility, but at this point, reworking the Ingenium Second Edition manuscript is purely a creative exercise.</p>
