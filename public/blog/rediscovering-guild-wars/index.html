	Rediscovering Guild Wars
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">June 16, 2012</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>Years ago, my wife and I picked up Guild Wars on a whim. We played a little bit, maybe a few hours, over the course of a week… and then abandoned it to return to World of Warcraft or Everquest II or something along those lines.</p>
<p>With all the fervor surrounding Guild Wars 2, and my reignited interest in that game, I decided to reinstall my copy of Guild Wars and see what I had missed.</p>
<p>And, with all honesty, I can't believe I didn't buy heavily into this in the first place.</p>
<p>I have two characters I'm switching between at the moment - a Necromancer/Ranger, and a Warrior who I'll probably mix with a Mesmer or Ranger. The way the game mixes classes and skills, and enables you to further mix that up by choosing your set of active skills whenever you're in town.</p>
<p>I have not yet had a chance to get deep into the lore, but I recognized the attacking Charr immediately in the initial cutscene for Guild Wars. I'm greatly looking forward to exploring the original game before being able to afford jumping into its sequel. While usually I go for sandbox MMORPGs, I think in this case I'm most interested in exploring the character-centric nature of GW2, and in Guild Wars 1 by going through the many available stories.</p>
<p>I would love to find a group of folks to game with, if any of you reading this play Guild Wars!</p>
