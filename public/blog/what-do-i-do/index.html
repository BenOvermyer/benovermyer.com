	What do I do?
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">April 24, 2008</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>Today's post is inspired by a challenge from IttyBiz. The author, Naomi Dunford, reflected on how many readers aren't aware - through no fault of their own - of what we blog writers actually do for a living. So, the challenge was to answer five questions to introduce ourselves (again) to our readers:</p>
<h1 id="what-s-your-game-what-do-you-do">What's your game? What do you do?</h1>
<p>By day, I'm a web developer working for a major government contractor. By night, I'm a freelance web designer, artist, and writer.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-you-do-it-do-you-love-it-or-do-you-just-have-one-of-those-creepy-knacks">Why do you do it? Do you love it, or do you just have one of those creepy knacks?</h1>
<p>I love web design. It's the perfect melding of programming, art, and writing.</p>
<h1 id="who-are-your-customers-what-kind-of-people-would-need-or-want-what-you-offer">Who are your customers? What kind of people would need or want what you offer?</h1>
<p>Most of my clients are game companies. I've done artwork or websites for a fair few people as individual commissions too. Usually, the people interested in my services are those looking for a friendly face and an understanding of the game industry that just isn't there for the majority of web design companies.</p>
<h1 id="what-s-your-marketing-usp-why-should-i-buy-from-you-instead-of-the-other-losers">What's your marketing USP? Why should I buy from you instead of the other losers?</h1>
<p>I don't know what a USP is, but I'll say this - I'm the guy who knows what I'm doing, and I know what my clients are doing too. At the end of the day, I'm a gamer as well as a designer!</p>
<h1 id="what-s-next-for-you-whats-the-big-plan">What's next for you? Whats the big plan?</h1>
<p>Right now, Mana Trance Creative - the name I do business as a freelancer under - is pretty low on my list of priorities. I take a new client once every three months or so, much reduced from when I was just out of college (and unemployed). However, over the next year I'll be slowly building up MTC. My goal is to be self-employed at roughly the same standard of living I have now by December of 2009. So, if any of you reading this needs a website (or art) or knows someone who does, shoot me an email!</p>
