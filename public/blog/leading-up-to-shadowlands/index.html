	Leading Up to Shadowlands
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">September 30, 2020</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>The Shadowlands expansion for World of Warcraft comes out next month. A lot of things seem to be happening in October this year. I'm opting to focus my gaming time on WoW, given the new expansion.</p>
<p>A month ago, I was playing a lot of WoW. The new expansion offers a lot of opportunities for starting new characters, and I wanted to unlock the Vulpera allied race to try something new. Unlocking that race previously required completing a particular story arc and reaching Exalted status with the Vulpera. I'd finished the story arc, but the reputation grind was quite a slog, and I hadn't come close to finishing it.</p>
<p>Then, I discovered that the pre-patch for Shadowlands was going to remove the reputation grind from unlocking allied races. This completely killed my interest in playing WoW before the pre-patch hits, and I haven't played since, despite keeping my subscription active.</p>
<p>As soon as the pre-patch is live, I'm diving back into the game with a vengeance. My new character will be a Vulpera shaman. I want to play a healer, and the Vulpera shaman's totems are fox-shaped which I love.</p>
<p>The new leveling experience takes you from 1 to 50 (the new pre-expansion cap) in a single expansion's content. I'm going to go through Wrath of the Lich King as my choice, since that remains my favorite expansion so far. It remains to be seen if I will blog about this process or not, but it might be fun to journal my experience. I don't think I'll be able to reach level 50 with my Vulpera before the expansion lands, but that's going to be my goal anyway.</p>
<p>I don't know if pet battle levels will be rewired too, but if they are, I definitely want to try and bring at least one group of pets up to level cap during my leveling. We'll see how that works out.</p>
<p>So yeah. I'll be retiring Exsecratus as my main, which is only the second time I've ever changed mains since I first started playing WoW back in 2004. Here's to new beginnings!</p>
