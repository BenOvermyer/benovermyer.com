	Heraldry Generation Pt. 2: Go, Divisions, and Charges
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">March 21, 2018</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>This iteration had some dramatic changes. Specifically, I rewrote the entire program in Go. That part actually didn't take as much time as I'd thought. The resulting program is a bit messy, though, and I'll talk about that in a minute. First, let me tell you about the heraldry changes.</p>
<p>After having just the fess and pale divisions in the last iteration, I added the remainder of the basic ones: bend, bend sinister, saltire, quarterly, and chevron.</p>
<p>I also added the most basic of charges - those geometric shapes called “ordinaries.” Not all of the common ordinaries are in there yet, and some of them look a little askew. Since I manually created them through trial and error rather than through calculation, there are a number of problems that I'll need to sort out.</p>
<p>For example, here're a couple charges from the current iteration. Notice how they're a little off?</p>
<p><img src="/heraldry-pt-2/askew-saltire.svg" alt="This saltire's a little askew" /> <img src="/heraldry-pt-2/askew-pall.svg" alt="This pall is definitely not right" /></p>
<p>The other issue is that many of the designs that pop out of the generator don't look very visually appealing. A possible future iteration will be to add some kind of logic to fix that.</p>
<p>With all of that said, it produces some pretty decent results. Here are some of them:</p>
<p><img src="/heraldry-pt-2/bright-chevron.svg" alt="This chevron is energetic" /> <img src="/heraldry-pt-2/nice-bordure.svg" alt="A bordure to approve of" /> <img src="/heraldry-pt-2/pile-charge.svg" alt="The contrast here is interesting" /></p>
<p>OK, so now, let's talk about Go.</p>
<p>I had always intended to rewrite the program in Go; I was using PHP as a rapid prototyping language. However, I hit a wall not too far into development. The SVG library I was using ended up not supporting a number of features of SVG that I needed. I was able to work around it by stripping out that library and dealing with the raw XML of SVG, but this was somewhat cumbersome.</p>
<p>Then I discovered the excellent SVG Go package called, appropriately enough, SVGo. It had several of the things I needed. So, I just pulled the trigger and spent a morning rewriting the entire codebase.</p>
<p>The result is a much faster program that's easy to write code for.</p>
<p>It's not without its problems, though.</p>
<p>All of the code is in one giant file. Visualization definitions are inline and contained in large <code>switch</code> or <code>if</code> blocks. There are no unit tests (which has bit me a couple times already).</p>
<p>Now that I'm going to be adding more complex charges (like animals), I can't keep putting all of that in the same file. That's something I hope to address in the next iteration.</p>
