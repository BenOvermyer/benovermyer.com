	Taking up the writing habit again
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">September 19, 2015</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>A few days ago, I migrated all of my blog posts from my last primary blog on WordPress.com to this blog. In the process, I read over a lot of old posts. I noticed something interesting: back in 2007 and 2008, I was writing blog posts with fair regularity. Now, it's a rarity. The blog posts back then were fairly journal-like in character. They told a story of what I was working on, how I felt on certain subjects, and described some of my adventures in games I was playing at the time. The blog posts I wrote in the recent past trend towards the same thing when they're more frequent. When I choose to try and write something <em>useful</em>, like the Laravel on Docker post, it takes a lot longer, a lot more effort, and is a lot more intimidating to start on. So as I sit here sipping on my orange pekoe black tea, listening to relaxing acoustic guitar, and writing these words, I'm thinking that I should allow myself to write journal-style posts again. This, if for no other reason than to ingrain that old writing habit. It'll be easier to write the big, important stuff if the simple stuff - the writing - comes naturally, right?</p>
