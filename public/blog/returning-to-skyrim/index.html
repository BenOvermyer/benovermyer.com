	Returning to Skyrim
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">July 20, 2013</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>The last time I posted about Skyrim, it was shortly after release. You can read the first in the series here. At the time, I was playing on the Xbox 360 version. This time around, I've purchased the Legendary Edition for PC. I'm also playing a Destruction mage instead of the heavily armed and armored warrior I focused on in the 360 version.</p>
<p>Besides taking a completely different character route this time around, I'm also focusing much more on quests other than the main line. I own a small house that I've built but not yet furnished, gotten a fair ways through the College of Winterhold quest line, and continue to light up vampires that seem to crop up all the time in areas I'm traveling to.</p>
<p>I heard so many awesome things about mods for the game that I just had to get the PC version. That, and I couldn't take screenshots in the 360 version, which was infuriating for someone who blogs about games. Today, I read an article someone reblogged on Reddit about <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/behind-falskaar-a-massive-new-skyrim-mod-and-the-19-year-old-who-spent-a-year-building-it/">a mod called Falskaar</a>. Falskaar is unique in that it was produced chiefly by a 19 year old who declined to go to university in order to produce the mod. It took him a full year, and he's aiming to get a job at Bethesda by proving his dedication.</p>
<p>By all accounts, it's a damned good mod. I look forward to installing it when I finish with vanilla Skyrim.</p>
<p>If you're interested in hearing further about my adventures in Skyrim, by all means, let me know in the comments. Otherwise, next week I'll be writing about a topic near and dear to my heart…. sci-fantasy sandbox MMORPGs.</p>
