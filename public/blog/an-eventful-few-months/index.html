	An Eventful Few Months
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">October 27, 2021</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>It's been an eventful few months. Since my last blog post back in August, I've had Lasik surgery, had a house deal fall through, discovered a new hobby, rediscovered an old one, and edged deeper into the Apple ecosystem. That's not even counting all the various developments in my professional life.</p>
<p>Lasik was expensive and the procedure was deeply uncomfortable, but worth it. For most of my life I've been near-blind without glasses. For the last month, though, I've had perfect vision. I still catch myself marveling at how awesome it is to have vision like this.</p>
<p>The house deal... well, that sucked and was expensive, but it ultimately made me realize the value of renting indefinitely. So that'll keep happening.</p>
<p>After abandoning Blizzard forever, I looked around for a new game to devote my lazy hours to. I landed on Final Fantasy XIV. After joining the Free Company &quot;Mystic Exiles,&quot; I realized I'd found a new home. The Exiles are a great group of people - really friendly, really helpful, and genuinely caring. It feels like a second family. I have never had an MMORPG guild experience like that before. Plus, the game itself is a ton of fun. At time of writing, I'm barely into the content from the second expansion, and the fourth expansion is only a couple weeks away from launch. This will keep my attention for awhile, I imagine.</p>
<p>The old hobby that I rediscovered is Warhammer 40k. A friend of mine invited me to a tournament he's hosting at his game store in Iowa, and I decided to dust off (literally) my boxes of miniatures and re-enter the fold. It's cost quite a lot of money to get all the new rulebooks, miniatures, and equipment I need to participate in the tournament, but I'm excited about the whole hobby again.</p>
<p>Almost a month ago I bought a new iPhone 13 Pro and gave my iPhone 11 Pro to my wife. Since she was on Android before, and we chiefly used Facebook Messenger to communicate, this opened up a host of new options for us. Now we use mostly iMessage and avoid Facebook if at all possible. It's a little annoying to not have iMessage on Windows, but at least when I'm using my Mac I can type out messages to her.</p>
<p>As for all of the developments in my professional life, well, that could be a whole 'nother blog post all on its own. Suffice it to say that the technology that I spend most of my dayjob hours on has changed dramatically, and I'm addressing some interesting new challenges. I'm really starting to dig Hashicorp Nomad as an alternative to Kubernetes.</p>
<p>So that's a bit of what I've been up to the past couple months.</p>
