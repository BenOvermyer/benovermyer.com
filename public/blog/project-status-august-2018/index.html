	Project Status, August 2018
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">August  9, 2018</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>Previously, I was spending most of my attention on the Uncharted Worlds projects that I've been working on. The random character generator and the “Character Creator” in particular were focuses. I was also spending time thinking about the next two projects in that vein, especially the star system generator.</p>
<p>However, that's changed. With my renewed interest in Silver Gryphon Games and its wellbeing as a company, I've shifted my focus almost entirely from coding projects for other peoples' games to writing and business projects for my own company.</p>
<p>This is probably too long in coming.</p>
<p>I've moved away from the “eh, Kevin will deal with it” mindset and towards a “if I don't do it, it won't happen” mindset. This is not to say I don't delegate some things (my fiancée Sarah is a wonderful editor). However, the health of the company is in jeopardy unless I step in and take the helm.</p>
<p>Here are some specific actions I've taken or plan on taking to bring SGG back on track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get atomic units of work onto our Trello kanban board</li>
<li>Reignite efforts to have frequent, meaningful updates on our blog</li>
<li>Review DriveThruRPG sales figures to plan marketing promotions and product schedules</li>
<li>Get all of our files into one central place so everyone in the company has access to them</li>
<li>Review the legal documents for the company to refresh my memory of the structure and obligations</li>
<li>Review the company's financials to see if a cash injection is needed</li>
<li>Plan out product schedules for the next 18 months</li>
<li>Look at better, less generic WordPress themes for the SGG website</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is not an exhaustive list, but it's a start.</p>
