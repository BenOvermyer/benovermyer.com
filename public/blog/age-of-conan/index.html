<h1 class="page-title">
	Age of Conan
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">July  1, 2008</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>So I purchased Age of Conan, despite the numerous reviews saying that the game is heavily broken.</p>
<p>So far, it's not bad. I haven't reached the magical level 20 yet, where according to reviews all content dries up and disappears. I hear that crafting is completely broken and unusable. However, for the time being, I'm enjoying beating the snot out of lots of things…and I especially like switching between solo-instance and multiplayer-open areas. I look forward to the PvP.</p>
<p>I'm also subscribed now to EverQuest II. EQ2 ran a promotion where I was given two months access to the game, with a trial of all released expansions and adventure packs to date. The kicker, and what made me subscribe again, is that I get to KEEP all those things if I subscribed within the trial period. I'll maintain my subscription for awhile and probably cancel it later, but at least I'll have gotten all that extra content…for only the price of a single month's subscription.</p>
<p>In Star Wars Galaxies, the Fifth Anniversary event is going on. I acquired the items, but I'm slightly irritated at the way the badge and title for the event are being handed out. Only 24 players - one for every hour - each day are given the Hero of Empire Day reward, and the event only lasts until July 22nd, so a large majority of players will never receive it despite trying for it. I suppose this gives some value to the reward, then, for being scarce. I think a quest would have been a better dispersal mechanism, though.</p>
