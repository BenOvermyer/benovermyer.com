	Another Forgotten Project: Mysteries of a Broken World

<div class="blog-content">
<p>Three years ago, I was working on the last project I would touch at Silver Gryphon Games. It was an old-school revival game called <em>Mysteries of a Broken World</em>. It was meant to be a fantasy post-apocalyptic game and cleave close to the design paradigms of OSR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple rules</li>
<li>Pulpy settings</li>
<li>Brutal combat</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote several blog articles on my now-defunct Accio Inspirante blog about the game. After Silver Gryphon Games met its end, I forgot it even existed. This morning while cleaning up some things in my WordPress.com account I noticed Accio Inspirante and took a look around. On the principle that I'm collecting all of my works in one place, I moved all of the blog posts from there into this site. You can read them here:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.benovermyer.com/blog/designing-an-osr-game-part-2/">Designing an OSR Game Part 2: Freeholds and Fatality</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.benovermyer.com/blog/designing-an-osr-game-part-3/">Designing an OSR Game Part 3: Names, Backgrounds, and Playtests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.benovermyer.com/blog/designing-an-osr-game-part-4/">Designing an OSR Game Part 4: Alignment, Treasure, and Exploration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When I took a look at the manuscript for <em>Mysteries of a Broken World</em>, it was in quite the state. I converted it from Markdown to LaTeX, like I've done for Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire and for Ingenium Second Edition. While I was converting it, I saw a lot that I liked about the system.</p>
<p>I added Mysteries to my in-progress games. The PDF is available on the RPGs page if you want to see what it's like. I'll continue working on it alongside VD:KSF and I2E.</p>
