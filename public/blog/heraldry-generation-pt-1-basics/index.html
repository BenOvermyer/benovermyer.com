	Heraldry Generation Pt. 1: Basics
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">March 12, 2018</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>Awhile back I noted that I was beginning to work on a random fantasy setting generation project. This is the first piece of that.</p>
<p>It represents part of the design philosophy of the setting generator: each piece does one thing, it does it well, and it does it in a way that can be shared amongst the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The heraldry generator starts out life, then, with this guiding principle: output an image in a common format that can be programmatically modified, along with the necessary metadata to describe what's in the image for both humans and machines.</p>
<p>For the image format, I chose SVG. It's basically just XML, which makes it easy to modify, and it's relatively small. Also, it's a vector format, which makes it trivial to scale without degradation.</p>
<p>For rapidity of development, I chose to code the generator in PHP. I may rewrite it in a more performant language later if necessary. For now though, this serves my purposes.</p>
<p>Initially, I used a pre-existing library that handles SVG. However, after I got the initial plain-field version working, I discovered that the library doesn't support <code>&lt;mask&gt;</code> elements yet, which meant I wouldn't be able to easily generate field divisions and clip them.</p>
<p>The second iteration, then, stripped out that library and went straight for raw XML manipulation. This ended up working much better for several other things, including arbitrary attribute manipulation.</p>
<p>Heraldry adheres to certain rules. Coats of arms are basically like modern-day road signs; they exist to communicate clearly at a distance. So here are the rules I'm assuming for the generator:</p>
<ol>
<li>If a charge is a metal, its field may not be primarily a metal, and likewise with colors.</li>
<li>Only fields and charges common to Continental heraldry in the era between the 10th and 16th centuries will be considered.</li>
<li>Tinctures will include colors, metals, and furs common for the era. English “stains” like <em>sanguine</em> will not be included.</li>
</ol>
<p>I may modify this list later, but it's my guiding set right now.</p>
<p>At the moment, the generator only creates coats of arms with basic fields. It's either a single color, or includes <em>per fess</em> or <em>per pale</em> divisions, also in colors. Metals are being reserved for charges at the moment, which are not included yet.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example of a plain field:</p>
<p><img src="/heraldry-basic-field.svg" alt="Basic Field" /></p>
<p>The tincture generation is being done at a higher level so that the program is aware of which tinctures are used in the entire design. This is so it can avoid violating the first rule.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the divisions are generated in the same color (e.g., <em>azure</em> next to <em>azure</em>). I'll need to fix this in the next iteration.</p>
<p>The below image may look identical to the first one, but it's actually divided, just with both halves being <em>vert</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/heraldry-duplicate-colors.svg" alt="Duplicate Colors in a Division" /></p>
<p>Still, the basic design looks reasonable thus far. Here's a simple <em>per fess</em> example:</p>
<p><img src="/heraldry-basic-division.svg" alt="Basic Division" /></p>
<p>The source code for the generator is available <a href="https://github.com/ironarachne/heraldry">on GitHub</a>.</p>
