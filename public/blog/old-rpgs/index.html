	Old RPGs of Mine

<div class="blog-content">
<p>I've been designing games for almost as long as I've been playing them. I made my first board games in my single digits in the late 80s and early 90s.</p>
<p>My first role-playing games happened a little later, in my early teens. Thankfully, I kept hard copies of them around. Today I spent some time transcribing them and recreating their original logos. After putting them into my standard LaTeX-based manuscript workflow, I produced PDFs of each of them. Now I've added them to this site. None of them are good, but they might give you a little insight into where I came from, design-wise.</p>
<p><a href="/rpg/huckfinn">Huck Finn: The Role-Playing Game</a>: I made this for an English class a long time ago.</p>
<p><a href="/rpg/stargazer">Stargazer</a>: This was a weird superhero RPG that gives characters classes based on their jurisdiction. It includes some strange races.</p>
<p><a href="/rpg/stellar-warfare">Stellar Warfare</a>: Probably my first RPG ever. It was loosely based on Star Wars, and reflects a love of space combat and the Dark Side.</p>
