	On Forever Projects
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">October 28, 2020</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>I just finished reading a blog post entitled <a href="https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-forever-project.html">The Forever Project</a> by Scott Turner of Here Dragons Abound. It made me reflect on Iron Arachne and what I'm trying to do with it.</p>
<p>Lately I've been taking a break from Iron Arachne, and while on that break, I've found that I lack motivation or interest in continuing it. But this blog post made me reconsider that. It's not that I lack motivation or interest in <em>Iron Arachne</em>, but rather that I've been too focused on developing the site as a tool for others to use and not near enough on what I originally started it for.</p>
<p>Iron Arachne is my &quot;forever project,&quot; as the article calls it. It's an endless creative exploration meant to delve into many, many different topics at the drop of a hat. It's not meant to be complete, or bug-free, or even useful. I had forgotten that.</p>
<p>In the context of this revelation, I'm taking a look at what Iron Arachne is currently and where I'd like to take it. I definitely don't want to do another rewrite. However, I think I would like to start exploring more random concepts. To that end, I'm going to follow some of the advice from Scott and write a bunch of new issues in GitLab that are just ideas of things to try - small ones, medium ones, big ones, and pie-in-the-sky ones.</p>
<p>I also will need to reinstate my weekly ritual of coding on Sunday mornings, but I think I'll broaden the scope of that a bit to be &quot;work on Iron Arachne&quot; instead of coding. That means anything that falls within that context is fair game - so, I could code, or I could do artwork, or read about geology, or write issues, or write a blog post, or anything else that fits the mold.</p>
<p>Now that I'm getting this down in writing, I'm finally getting excited about Iron Arachne again. That's a tremendous sign that I'm on the right track.</p>
