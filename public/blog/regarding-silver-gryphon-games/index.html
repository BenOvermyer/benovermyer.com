	Regarding Silver Gryphon Games
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">January 14, 2018</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>In late 2014, I stepped down from my role at Silver Gryphon Games. I had too much going on in my life to properly pay attention to the company.</p>
<p>In early 2017, I felt I had sorted out enough that I could return, and so I did. I hadn't returned with the kind of rigor that a dormant company needs to be successful, though, and 2017 was largely a wash as far as SGG was concerned.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday I met with the other co-founder Kevin online. We discussed what was necessary to bring the company back from the dead. I was adamant about getting our undelivered Kickstarter project completed and delivered. We established a weekly recurring meeting and I set up a kanban board in Trello to track work in progress.</p>
<p>This is probably more effort than SGG has seen in years as far as planning goes. For the first time since 2014, I feel like SGG has a shot at being successful.</p>
<p>Our focus is going to be on clearing our pre-existing backlog. While Kevin and I have always been good at idea generation, we've been less successful at follow-through, and that's where I want us to shine this year.</p>
