	Upgrading the Iron Arachne planet generator
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">April 22, 2022</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>Today I upgraded the graphics for the <a href="https://ironarachne.com/#/planet">planet generator on Iron Arachne</a>.</p>
<p>It was not a small task, as I taught myself how to do domain warping and rewrote most of the GLSL shaders
that are used to create these graphics.</p>
<p>But first, the only one that did NOT get changed, because I like it as is:</p>
<img src="gasgiant.png" class="photo" />
<p>I might end up tweaking the gas giant a bit, but not today.</p>
<img src="arid.png" class="photo" />
<p>The arid planet is a little more colorful, but still looks bleak. The new cloud shader is
a huge improvement.</p>
<img src="barren.png" class="photo" />
<p>It's less obvious in this particular shot, but the barren planet gained a lot more detail
in its surface texture. I still don't care for how I did the vertex displacement, but eh, that can
wait for another day.</p>
<img src="garden.png" class="photo" />
<p>The garden world was the hardest. I'm still not happy with it, but it's better than it was.</p>
<img src="jungle.png" class="photo" />
<p>The jungle world looks much better. It definitely has more of a forested feel.</p>
<img src="ice.png" class="photo" />
<p>The ice world is much more colorful than it used to be. Originally I was going to go for
a color scheme similar to the original, but I liked this version too much and kept it.</p>
<img src="ocean.png" class="photo" />
<p>The ocean world now feels a lot less plastic and has more detail to it. The new clouds help.</p>
<img src="swamp.png" class="photo" />
<p>The new swamp world looks just as unfriendly as the original, but perhaps more colorful now.
I might tone down the brighter hues in the future.</p>
<img src="toxic.png" class="photo" />
<p>The toxic world is less cartoony now. It no longer has the neon green oceans and generally
looks like an awful place to visit.</p>
<img src="volcanic.png" class="photo" />
<p>The new volcanic world is much more volcano-y. Instead of just oceans of lava, there are
now rivers too, and the glow is less pronounced.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it's a pretty impressive upgrade, though there's still a lot of work
to be done. At some point I really want to figure out atmospheric scattering.</p>
