	Looking Ahead to 2023
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">January  1, 2023</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>This year I don't have to worry about an upcoming move or an expensive vacation, so I can focus on other things.</p>
<p>I'm going to follow up my successful abandonment of alcohol with a reduction in portion sizes at meals. My goal is to reduce body fat percentage. To aid in this and to improve my cardio health, I'm also going to be more regular about going for walks. I'm also going to consider getting a gym membership again after the New Year Resolution folks quit after the first month. I may be able to get away with just our home gym equipment, but it might be good for me to get out of the house more.</p>
<p>Silver Gryphon Games will have a lot of my attention this year. I want to release Aether and Aethermancy in the first quarter. Aethermancy is dependent on Kevin, but Aether is under my control. At the very least, I should be able to get Aether out before the end of March.</p>
<p>Another goal I have for the first quarter is to not buy anything new for entertainment. I'm going to only occupy my free time with things I already have.</p>
<p>Related to both of the previous paragraphs, I'm going to only write content for Aether and Savage Worlds this year. No other RPG systems will have my attention. By doing this, I'm hoping to boost SGG's productivity in its first full year as a returned company.</p>
<p>I'm participating in the #dungeon23 challenge this year. The idea is to design a full megadungeon one room per day, one region per week, and one level per month.</p>
<p>There are fewer goals this year, but a greater chance of accomplishing all of them. Health and SGG are the two focuses for the year. I have other things I want to accomplish, but these are the ones I'm publicly committing to.</p>
