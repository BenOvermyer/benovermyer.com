	News sites in a post-advertisement world
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">May 29, 2019</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>This post is a response to &quot;<a href="https://bradleytaunt.com/2019/05/29/news-websites-are-dumpster-fires/">News Websites are Dumpster Fires</a>&quot;, which rails against the current business model of most news websites.</p>
<p>The problem that faces news websites is not as simple as just a business model change.</p>
<p>The purpose of a news website is to provide accurate, current information on topics relevant to the health and progress of society. This is an expensive endeavor. Journalism isn't easy - indeed, sometimes it can be dangerous, depending on the topic covered. It requires training, equipment, and no small amount of social savvy.</p>
<p>A news site can't be funded by the government without the appearance of state bias. The ad-driven model currently employed by the majority of news sites is unsustainable. How, then, can these sites be supported in a way that doesn't compromise their core mission?</p>
<p>This is a complicated question, and not one I have a solution for. I suspect that the future lies in content producers being funded by the public in some way. The following article may be of interest in this regard: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-there-a-news-organization-truly-funded-by-the-public">Why isn't there a news organization truly funded by the public</a></p>
