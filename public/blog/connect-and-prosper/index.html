<p>Something missing in a lot of big companies - whether office, factory, or what-have-you - is a sense of community and connectedness. There is frequently no connection between You and the Team. In the case of freelancers, it's between You and the Client. What do I mean by connection? I mean empathy. I mean that feeling you get when you really understand someone, and they understand you. There's way too much focus on Lone Wolf, out-for-number-one tactics out there. I recently read <a href="http://changethis.com/44.06.ConnectionCulture">Connection Culture by Michael Lee Stallard</a> and found myself nodding at every third paragraph. Michael's research is impeccable and his findings are both simple and profound. He goes into great detail about the hows and whys of connecting at the workplace. His conclusions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>connections at work make that company a great place to work for, and</li>
<li>in the case of customers and clients, that company becomes a great one to do business with.</li>
</ol>
<p>People are happier when they're connected. Michael doesn't go too much into scale and volume, but he does make notable mention of the fact that big companies that encourage communication and connection do demonstrably better work, backed up by trustworthy data. According to his research and my own personal experiences, people who make connections are happier, healthier, more optimistic, and generally more energetic than those who do not. So. When's the last time you made an effort to make connections in your workplace? Do you know the name of the guy in the cubicle across the way? If not, introduce yourself. Get to know the people you work with, for, and above, and you will find that the rewards greatly outweigh any remotely possible cost to yourself.</p>
