	Year in Review 2018
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">December 31, 2018</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>As 2018 comes to a close, I'm looking back on the year and reflecting.</p>
<p>It was a big year for me. On January 1, I proposed to my fiancee, and she accepted. We got married in October. In February, for the first time since 2005, I left the country. My fiancee, a couple friends of hers, and I all went to Punta Cana for a 7-day vacation. In May, I quit my job working for Spok and took a consultant position with Solution Design Group.</p>
<p>With encouragement and support from Sarah, I paid off most of my credit cards over the course of 2018. I also paid off one of my loans. I saved up enough to pay cash for our honeymoon to Thailand next year.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, I bought a current events book. I haven't been able to read much of it, though, since I normally read at night before bed and this particular book is the opposite of relaxing.</p>
<p>I also spent a great deal of time programming generator tools for tabletop role-playing games. This year marked the emergence of my website for such tools, Iron Arachne.</p>
<p>Finally, I started to really put normal effort into Silver Gryphon Games again. I've been blogging there regularly and working on multiple new books for the company.</p>
