	First week of wellness challenge
</h1>
<p class="blog-date">November  5, 2023</p>
<div class="blog-content">
<p>The first week of my November 2023 wellness challenge went well! Going without
alcohol has given me back a ton of calories I would otherwise have gained, and
I'm feeling more energetic every morning, too.</p>
<p>My first workout was on Wednesday morning at 5:00. It took me a bit to figure out 
where the stations and machines were that I needed for my workout plan. Some things
I had to improvise a bit on; there was no cable row, so I just used the rowing
machine.</p>
<p>My second workout on Friday morning was better. After blundering my way through
the first workout, I took time on Thursday to put together a gym bag. I brought
a log book and made sure to note down what weights I used for each exercise. I
was still a bit sore from Wednesday's workout, but by Saturday morning the soreness
from both sessions was gone.</p>
<p>This week coming up will be the last week of the &quot;warmup plan&quot; specified by my
program. The weeks following will be more involved, and will be four days a week
instead of three.</p>
<p>I've already started to lose a little weight. I'm looking forward to seeing
how far I can get this month.</p>
