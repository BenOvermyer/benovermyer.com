	Resumé
</h1>

<p>The chief aim of any web technologist is to make a particular part of the web more awesome for people. Or at least, it should be. The web was built for people. For the past several years I have worked as a devops engineer. Now I'm going back to my roots as a full-stack developer.</p>
<p><strong>Specialties:</strong> Infrastructure, back-end development (esp. Go), front-end development (esp. Svelte+TypeScript), performance, observability</p>
<p><strong>Preferred Programming Languages:</strong> TypeScript, Go, PHP, Python</p>
<p><strong>Ancillary Skills:</strong> Team leadership, mentoring, architectural design, tailoring communication of important information to different audiences</p>
<h1 id="work-history">Work History</h1>
<p>This work history only includes my professional career and does not include my role at <a href="https://silvergryphongames.com">Silver Gryphon Games</a>.</p>
<h2 id="senior-platform-engineer-tech-lead-at-apiture">Senior Platform Engineer (Tech Lead) at Apiture</h2>
<p><em>July 2021 to present</em></p>
<p>I help build and design the platform that underlies Apiture's services. I abstract away the AWS and Docker infrastructure so app developers can build for the platform and not need to understand infrastructure themselves. As a tech lead, I lead a team of platform engineers of varying skill levels and personalities towards this end. Often I wear multiple hats - architect, coder, mentor, troubleshooter, sounding board, and others.</p>
<h2 id="devops-consultant-at-solution-design-group">DevOps Consultant at Solution Design Group</h2>
<p><em>May 2018 to July 2021</em></p>
<p>I worked as a senior DevOps consultant to enable enterprise clients to meet their cloud infrastructure, automation, and containerization needs. In this capacity, I managed Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, architected infrastructure on AWS and Azure, converted legacy VMs into containerized workloads, and coached clients on best practices. I also ran the internal devops and tabletop games communities and volunteered for additional ad hoc community leadership roles occasionally.</p>
<h2 id="devops-engineer-at-spok-inc">DevOps Engineer at Spok, Inc</h2>
<p><em>November 2017 to May 2018</em></p>
<p>I helped build and automate systems to keep Spok at the forefront of secure communications technology. My focus was on monitoring and alerting systems, but I also worked extensively with AWS and Jenkins CI/CD. I discovered, helped mitigate, and recovered from an AWS breach.</p>
<h2 id="digital-manager-operations-at-the-minneapolis-star-tribune">Digital Manager, Operations at the Minneapolis Star Tribune</h2>
<p><em>September 2015 to November 2017</em></p>
<p>I managed the operations team for the digital department at the Star Tribune. I oversaw and guided the implementation and maintenance of their digital infrastructure, as well as lead initiatives to improve performance, reliability, cost effectiveness, and general awesomeness of the same. As a technical manager, roughly half of my time was spent doing the technical work alongside my direct reports.</p>
<h2 id="senior-software-engineer-at-the-minneapolis-star-tribune">Senior Software Engineer at the Minneapolis Star Tribune</h2>
<p><em>September 2013 to September 2015</em></p>
<p>I worked on a variety of systems to keep the <a href="http://www.startribune.com">Twin Cities' best newspaper</a> on the front edge of the digital frontier. Foremost, I was the lead operations engineer responsible for architecting the infrastructure for the Star Tribune's newly-rebuilt 2015 web platform. I built out AWS infrastructure using Ansible and designed the system to be scalable enough that it was able to weather the onslaught of traffic in the wake of Prince's death.</p>
<h2 id="senior-web-developer-at-sportsdigita">Senior Web Developer at Sportsdigita</h2>
<p><em>May 2013 to September 2013</em></p>
<p>For the most part, I worked on back end systems using PHP and MySQL, with a heavy dose of Symfony2 and Doctrine. I was also the core developer of a versatile survey platform, the front end of which I built in AngularJS.</p>
<h2 id="director-of-it-at-group-3-marketing">Director of IT at Group 3 Marketing</h2>
<p><em>August 2011 to May 2013</em></p>
<p>In addition to my duties as a lead developer, I managed the IT and development staff at G3M. In this capacity, I reduced IT infrastructure costs by 60% by migrating to the cloud, increased developer efficiency through the introduction of new processes like digital time tracking, and built client-tailored marketing databases and applications. I migrated legacy applications built on Visual Foxpro to PHP and lead development of a web-based loyalty rewards system built on Symfony2.</p>
<h2 id="software-engineer-at-chr-solutions">Software Engineer at CHR Solutions</h2>
<p><em>June 2011 to June 2011</em></p>
<p>I worked on telecommunications back end software using C# and C++.</p>
<h2 id="web-developer-at-stinger-ghaffarian-technologies-usgs-eros-data-center">Web Developer at Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies (USGS Eros Data Center)</h2>
<p><em>April 2008 to May 2011</em></p>
<p>I aided in the development and design of several geospatial data delivery web applications using Java and PHP. I reimagined, redesigned and took ownership of the LPDAAC internal message board and other internal web-based communications projects.</p>
<h2 id="web-developer-at-saic-inc-usgs-eros-data-center">Web Developer at SAIC, Inc. (USGS Eros Data Center)</h2>
<p><em>August 2007 to April 2008</em></p>

<h2 id="freelancer-at-mana-trance-creative-services">Freelancer at Mana Trance Creative Services</h2>
<p><em>June 2002 to August 2007</em></p>

<p><em>August 2006 to May 2007</em></p>
<p>Repaired and built computers, provided extensive customer support, designed and maintained company website, designed and implemented public relations and marketing campaigns, designed and produced all internal artwork, logos, and stationary.</p>
<h2 id="level-designer-at-binary-star">Level Designer at Binary Star</h2>
<p><em>January 2004 to June 2004</em></p>

<p><em>August 2002 to November 2002</em></p>
