<h1 class="page-title">
	Uses
</h1>

<p>This is a list of all the things that I use to be productive day-to-day. It's inspired by <a href="https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses">this page</a>.</p>
<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>
<h2 id="alienware-aurora-r11">Alienware Aurora R11</h2>
<p>I bought a dedicated gaming PC after I missed gaming too much on my Mac. For a long time I used Windows, but when I &quot;upgraded&quot; to Windows 11, I ran into too many issues and replaced it with Pop_OS! as my sole operating system. I'm loving gaming on Linux now that I've figured out how to properly use Proton.</p>
<h2 id="2019-macbook-pro-16">2019 MacBook Pro 16&quot;</h2>
<p>I replaced my old Windows/Linux custom-built PC with this on July 22nd, 2020. For a time I used it both for development and for gaming, but I missed my favorites too much. Now it's used exclusively for development and for travel.</p>
<h2 id="logitech-mx-keys">Logitech MX Keys</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard.920-009295.html">Logitech MX Keys</a></p>
<p>I use this keyboard for my Macbooks. It's great for quickly switching between them.</p>
<h2 id="steelseries-apex-pro-keyboard">Steelseries Apex Pro Keyboard</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-pro">Steelseries Apex Pro</a></p>
<p>This keyboard has a beautiful aesthetic, sturdy construction, and a typefeel that I just adore. It's great for gaming and typing.</p>
<h2 id="dell-s3220dgf-32-2k-monitor">Dell S3220DGF 32&quot; 2K monitor</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-curved-gaming-monitor-s3220dgf/apd/210-atyt/monitors-monitor-accessories">Dell 32 Curved Gaming Monitor - S3220DGF</a></p>
<p>I replaced my old ultrawidescreen monitor with this. It has a more common aspect ratio, a more stable stand, and much better refresh rate. Besides that, it also &quot;announces&quot; itself properly, meaning that macOS actually recognizes its capabilities. I have two of them - one for my Mac, and one for my gaming PC.</p>
<h2 id="beautyrest-platinum-sofil-bonded-leather-executive-chair">Beautyrest Platinum Sofil Bonded Leather Executive Chair</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.staples.com/beautyrest-platinum-sofil-bonded-leather-executive-chair-black-49404b/product_24381184">Beautyrest Platinum Sofil Bonded Leather Executive Chair, Black (49404B)</a></p>
<p>I replaced my DXRacer King Zero in March of 2022 with this chair. It's cheaper and more comfortable than the DXRacer was. The cats have already made a number of holes in the faux-leather, though.</p>
<h1 id="lifestyle-software">Lifestyle Software</h1>
<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>
<p>I've changed browsers frequently over the years. Now I seem to have settled on Firefox.</p>
<h1 id="design-software">Design Software</h1>
<h2 id="adobe-suite">Adobe Suite</h2>
<p>I caved and switched back to the Adobe Creative Suite instead of the Affinity suite. While the $60 per month price tag is steep, I needed too many of the features only Adobe's suite has.</p>
<h1 id="development-software">Development Software</h1>
<h2 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></p>
<p>In November 2022 I finally bought a license for Sublime Text. I've been using it as my daily driver for months now.</p>
<h1 id="hosting-and-infrastructure-services">Hosting and Infrastructure Services</h1>
<h2 id="namecheap">Namecheap</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a></p>
<p>I've heard that other domain registrars are better (e.g., <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a>), but I host almost all of my domains at Namecheap because it works well enough.</p>
<h2 id="hetzner">Hetzner</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a></p>
<p>When I need more than a static site host, I use Hetzner. It's cheap and stable.</p>
<h2 id="netlify">Netlify</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></p>
<p>Netlify hosts most of my static sites. It's free and works really well.</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare">Cloudflare</h2>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a></p>
<p>I use Cloudflare for my DNS management. I don't use it as a CDN anymore, though it works well for that purpose.</p>
