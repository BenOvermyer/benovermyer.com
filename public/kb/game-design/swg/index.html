	Inspired by SWG as it was meant to be
</h1>

<p>These are notes based on <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2015/04/15/star-wars-galaxies-tefs/">this set of articles</a> on Raph Koster's website.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Not skill trees, but skill webs</p>
<p>Greater range, less focus on the close-in</p>
<p>Interdependence between player roles</p>
<p>Cater to all player types (i.e. Bartle types), let players play what they want</p>
<p>All scenarios in the movies should be possible in the game</p>
<p>&quot;The spirit of the game was all about changing your character up over time, and trying new things&quot;</p>
<p>Reece Thornton designed the resource system in SWG (e.g., the 474 subtypes of resources, and the random generation, etc.)</p>
<p>474 subtypes of resources arranged in a tree</p>
<p>Perlin noise used to generate their spots</p>
<p>Once tapped out, a resource area would be gone forever</p>
<p>Only some resources would ever spawn at a given time; it might be weeks or even months before a particular type showed up</p>
<p>Raph thinks harvesters should have needed to be re-built every time the resource they were mining changed</p>
<p>He also thinks crafters should have been limited to at most 10 crafting recipes at a time to encourage interdependence</p>
<p>Everything was tradeable, with no bio-attunment/soulbinding.</p>
<p>Everything was damaged with use/decayed and could be repaired (by a player).</p>
<p>The commodities market was intentionally not a full auction house in order to prevent “Wal-Marts” or “Amazons” from showing up and eliminating the ability to compete on price.</p>
<p>The original intent was to let players create missions for other players to deliver items for them.</p>
<p>There was no (meaningful) loot in the game.</p>
<p>There was a system for marketing and merchant-ery in the game that made owning and operating a business a system in itself.</p>
<p>Combat was supposed to be a rock-paper-scissors of the various disciplines and weapon types (e.g., snipers sucked against melee rogue types, pistoleers sucked against snipers, etc.)</p>
<p>HAM (Health-Action-Mind) was intended to be “bouncy”, with use of specials creating brief periods of weakness (“lowering shields”) that could be exploited by careful enemies</p>
<p>Buffs were never supposed to give more than a 10% increase in efficiency, certainly not the 400% that the SWG buff system gave</p>
<p>There were going to be “third places” where players went during downtime because they wanted to, not because they were forced to (e.g., theaters, bars, etc.)</p>
<p>The point was to encourage players to meet and talk and generally be sociable</p>
<p>Camps that scouts and rangers could build were intended to be bastions of support behind the front lines</p>
<p>PTSD was modeled into SWG in the form of “battle fatigue” that could only be healed by entertainers</p>
<p>Originally, there was supposed to be two music professions: composing and performing.</p>
<p>Composing was dropped due to legal concerns (like people arranging pre-existing songs in the game)</p>
<p>The musician system had a “concert master” that could direct a group of musicians to operate in concert</p>
<p>This enabled touring bands with particular routines that they set up</p>
<p>Theater professions (acting, script-writing) were dropped, sadly</p>
<p>The Writer profession was intended to be able to produce not only in-game books, but publish RSS feeds of those works, and allow Writers to charge (in-game) to read a work, or allow them to ask for tips on a read</p>
<p>In order to Master some skills, XP gained from teaching other players was required</p>
<p>Your avatar’s facial expressions, body language, and “tone of voice” would be customizable and intertwined</p>
<p>A chat box is a reminder that you’re playing a game; so, they added chat bubbles above avatars’ heads</p>
<p>Player missions were dropped because social graphing is expensive, and it would be hard to prevent griefing</p>
<p>Unfortunately… that basically killed the intended function of Smugglers and Bounty Hunters.</p>
<p>Laying down roads and re-texturing terrain in and around player cities was intended, but never successfully added</p>
<p>Creature taming was deliberately designed to work with, and around, animal social behavior</p>
<p>Pets would be tamed as babies and grow over time into adults</p>
<p>Pets would be taught their name through repetition of commands</p>
<p>Droids were originally intended to have the same emotional attachment, but this never came to be</p>
