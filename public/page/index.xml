      <description>The chief aim of any web technologist is to make a particular part of the web more awesome for people. Or at least, it should be. The web was built for people. For my part, I now manage a team of engineers responsible for building out performant and highly-available digital infrastructure. My history as an engineer in the same capacity and my particular talents for guiding others and seeing the big picture have led me down this path.</description>

      <description>Open Source Projects I&amp;rsquo;m particularly interested in procedural generation of fictional worlds. Here are a few of my projects in that vein:
 Country Maker A fantasy country generator. My current project.
 Name Generator A constructed-language name generator.
  Tabletop Games Over the years I’ve released a variety of books, articles, and other documents into the wild. Some of these were published in the true print sense, and some were only released online.</description>

      <description>Professional Background I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer who loves the web. Not just web technology, mind you; the very idea of the web. Since its inception, it has changed the world. It&amp;rsquo;s my job and my passion to make it better.
I have travelled the world, lived abroad, and usually only ever lived in one place for a couple years. That changed when I moved to Minneapolis. Of all the places I&amp;rsquo;ve lived on this globe, Minneapolis has been my favorite.</description>
