	Turmeric Chicken with Chickpeas
</h1>

<p>This was taken from <a href="https://food52.com/recipes/83166-turmeric-chicken-recipe-with-crispy-chickpeas">Food52</a>, with some modifications.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes</li>
<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
<li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
<li>14 ounces cooked chickpeas (one can)</li>
<li>3/4 cup plain full-fat yogurt (regular or Greek)</li>
<li>1 lemon, cut in wedges, for serving</li>
<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro, for serving</li>
<li>4 pieces warm pita or flatbread, for serving, or 4 handfuls fresh greens and/or leafy herbs</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Dry well with a cotton towel. Set aside.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in a bowl, toss chicken with turmeric, smoked paprika, chili flakes, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil until evenly coated.</li>
<li>In a 12-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat. Add chicken, distributing the pieces so they're in a single, even layer. Cook without moving for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook until nicely browned, about 3 to 4 minutes longer. Remove skillet from the heat, and transfer chicken to a plate, leaving all of the spiced fat in the skillet.</li>
<li>While the chicken is resting, make the chickpeas. Return the skillet to medium-low heat, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon to loosen any bits of food. Add another 1 tablespoon olive oil, then the chickpeas and a few pinches of salt, stirring to evenly coat in the spiced fat. It'll seem like a lot of fat, but trust me, it's key for the crispiest, crunchiest chickpeas.</li>
<li>Cook the chickpeas for about 10 to 12 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. The idea is to go low and slow so the chickpeas become ultra-crispy on the outside, still creamy on the inside. Some will pop and split as they dry and crisp. Taste and add a little more turmeric and/or smoked paprika if desired. When they're done, turn off the heat and stir in cilantro.</li>
<li>While the chickpeas are cooking, make the yogurt sauce by combining yogurt, 2 teaspoons lemon juice (cut the remaining lemon into wedges for serving), a pinch or two of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired. Adjust seasoning and acidity, to taste.</li>
<li>Serve chicken and crispy chickpeas while still warm with warmed pita, yogurt sauce, fresh greens or herbs, and lemon wedges.</li>
</ol>
