We found the original version of this recipe on a website called "Budget Bytes." Below
is my modified version.

This is really flavorful and comforting. I like to add a generous dose of hot sauce after
serving.

# Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp fresh ginger, grated
- 1 small yellow onion, diced
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 cup brown lentils
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 13 oz. can coconut milk
- 3 cups fresh spinach, chopped
- 4 cups Jasmine rice
- fresh cilantro, for garnish

# Instructions

1. Heat a medium pot or Dutch oven on medium heat. Add the olive oil, garlic, and ginger and cook for 1 minute.
2. Add the onion and cook until translucent.
3. Add the curry powder and cook for another minute.
4. Add the lentils and broth. Stir well. Put a lid on the pot, turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring to a boil.
5. Once boiling, turn the heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Add the can of coconut milk and stir to combine. Turn the heat up to medium and simmer without a lid for 10 minutes, stirring often.
7. Once thickened, turn off the heat. Add the spinach and stir gently until wilted.
8. Adjust with salt or curry powder as desired.
9. Serve over rice with cilantro for a garnish.
