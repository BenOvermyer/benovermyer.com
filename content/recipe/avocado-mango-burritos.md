# Ingredients

## Avocado Mango Salsa

-   2 mangos
-   1 avocado
-   1 medium red onion
-   3 tablespoons fresh cilantro
-   juice of 1 lime
-   3 garlic cloves

## Black Bean Filling

-   1 can black beans, rinsed and drained
-   1 large red bell pepper, julienned
-   2 jalapeños, chopped
-   juice of 1/2 lime
-   flour tortillas

## Optional Extras

-   Sour cream
-   Crumbled fresh cotija

# Instructions

## Make the salsa

1. Roughly chop the mangos, avocado, and onion small enough to fit into a food processor
2. Add all of the salsa ingredients to the food processor and finely chop (but don't puree)

## Make the filling

1. Heat a bit of olive oil or avocado oil in a pan on medium heat
2. Sautee the bell pepper and jalapeños for a few minutes
3. Add the black beans and reduce heat to medium-low, cooking for a few more minutes
4. Turn off the heat and add the lime juice. Mix well.

Put the filling on the tortillas first, then add the salsa. I enjoy adding a bit of sour cream and crumbled cotija cheese to finish off the burritos.
