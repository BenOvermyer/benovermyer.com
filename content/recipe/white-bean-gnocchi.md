title = "White bean and sun-dried tomato gnocchi"
+++

This is originally based on a recipe from EatingWell by Laura Kanya. The next time I make it I will add some heat element, like serrano peppers or red pepper flakes, to give it more kick.

# Ingredients

- 1/2 cup sliced sun-dried tomatoes
- 1 16 oz. package shelf-stable gnocchi
- 1 15 oz. can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 5 oz. package baby spinach
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1/3 cup vegetable broth
- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 1 Tbsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp ground pepper

# Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add gnocchi and cook, stirring often, until plumped and starting to brown.
2. Add beans and spinach and cook until the spinach is wilted. Transfer to a plate.
3. Add more oil to the pan and heat over medium heat. Add sun-dried tomatoes and onion and cook, stirring, for about a minute.
4. Increase heat to high and add broth. Cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes.
5. Reduce heat to medium and stir in cream, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Return the gnocchi mixture to the pan and stir to coat with sauce.
