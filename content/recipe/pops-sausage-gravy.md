title = "Pop's Sausage Gravy"
+++

This is my dad's recipe. He makes biscuits and gravy every special occasion.
My own recipe was originally inspired by this but has a number of changes.

# Ingredients

- 1 lb. Jimmy Dean pork sage sausage
- 1 tsp. dried or fresh sage
- 1/4 of a large onion, chopped
- 1/2 stick butter
- 1 cup flour
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp powdered chicken base or bullion
- 6 cups skim milk
- (optional) 1 Tbsp Lipton onion soup mix
- (optional) 3 slices cooked, chopped bacon

# Instructions

1. Fry sausage and sage with onion over med-high heat until thoroughly browned. Drain and set aside.
2. Melt the butter in a dutch oven over low heat - don't let it brown.
3. Add the flour, pepper, salt, and crushed red pepper and make a roux.
4. Cook for awhile over medium heat until the roux is just browned, using a whisk to make sure nothing sticks ot the bottom of the kettle.
5. Add the milk and chicken base powder all at once and heat over medium heat using a whisk until thickening starts.
6. Add the sausage, and continue to cook until thick.
7. If it gets too thick, add milk just a little at a time until it's just the way you like it, and serve hot over biscuits.
