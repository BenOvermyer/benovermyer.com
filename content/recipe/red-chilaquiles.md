## Ingredients

### Red Sauce

-   3 tablespoons flour
-   1 tablespoon chili powder
-   1 teaspoon cumin
-   ½ teaspoon garlic powder
-   ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
-   ¼ teaspoon sea salt, to taste
-   a pinch of cinnamon
-   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   2 tablespoons tomato paste
-   2 cups vegetable broth
-   2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus additional for garnish
-   1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

### Everything Else

-   5 big handfuls corn tortilla chips
-   ⅓ cup crumbled cotija
-   1 small handful chopped green onion
-   1 ripe avocado, thinly sliced
-   4 fried eggs
-   1 small lime, cut into wedges

## Instructions

### The Sauce

1. To make the sauce: Measure the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and cinnamon into a small bowl. Place the bowl near the stove with the tomato paste and broth.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the oil until it’s hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact.
3. Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about a minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.
4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and your spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it.
5. Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting. Whisk in the cilantro and vinegar and season to taste with additional salt, if necessary.

### The Chilaquiles

1. To make the chilaquiles: Add the tortilla chips to the skillet. Using a flexible spatula, gently toss until all of the chips are coated in sauce. It might seem like they never will be, but keep stirring!
2. Once coated, remove the skillet from the heat. Test a chip to see if it has softened to your liking. If the chips are not sufficiently softened, cover the skillet for 1 to 4 minutes, until you’re happy with their texture.
3. Garnish the chilaquiles _generously_ with crumbled cotija, green onion and cilantro. Scoop servings onto individual plates, add a few slices of avocado, a fried egg, and a wedge of lime. Serve immediately.
