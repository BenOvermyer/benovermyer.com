This was taken from [Food52](https://food52.com/recipes/83166-turmeric-chicken-recipe-with-crispy-chickpeas), with some modifications.

## Ingredients

-   1 1/2 teaspoons ground turmeric
-   1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
-   1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
-   3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
-   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
-   1 1/2 pounds chicken thighs cut into bite-sized chunks
-   14 ounces cooked chickpeas (one can)
-   3/4 cup plain full-fat yogurt (regular or Greek)
-   1 lemon, cut in wedges, for serving
-   2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro, for serving
-   4 pieces warm pita or flatbread, for serving, or 4 handfuls fresh greens and/or leafy herbs

## Instructions

1. Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Dry well with a cotton towel. Set aside.
2. Meanwhile, in a bowl, toss chicken with turmeric, smoked paprika, chili flakes, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil until evenly coated.
3. In a 12-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high heat. Add chicken, distributing the pieces so they're in a single, even layer. Cook without moving for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook until nicely browned, about 3 to 4 minutes longer. Remove skillet from the heat, and transfer chicken to a plate, leaving all of the spiced fat in the skillet.
4. While the chicken is resting, make the chickpeas. Return the skillet to medium-low heat, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon to loosen any bits of food. Add another 1 tablespoon olive oil, then the chickpeas and a few pinches of salt, stirring to evenly coat in the spiced fat. It'll seem like a lot of fat, but trust me, it's key for the crispiest, crunchiest chickpeas.
5. Cook the chickpeas for about 10 to 12 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. The idea is to go low and slow so the chickpeas become ultra-crispy on the outside, still creamy on the inside. Some will pop and split as they dry and crisp. Taste and add a little more turmeric and/or smoked paprika if desired. When they're done, turn off the heat and stir in cilantro.
6. While the chickpeas are cooking, make the yogurt sauce by combining yogurt, 2 teaspoons lemon juice (cut the remaining lemon into wedges for serving), a pinch or two of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired. Adjust seasoning and acidity, to taste.
7. Serve chicken and crispy chickpeas while still warm with warmed pita, yogurt sauce, fresh greens or herbs, and lemon wedges.
