We tried this Indonesian dish on a vegetarian week. With a few tweaks
it's a really easy meal.

# Ingredients

- 2 8 oz. blocks of tempeh, sliced into matchsticks
- 1/4 cup high heat oil
- 3 medium shallots, thinly sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 3 Fresno chile peppers, thinly sliced
- 2 habanero peppers, finely chopped
- 1 Tbsp lemongrass powder
- 1 Tbsp kaffir lime powder
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 medium red/orange/yellow bell peppers, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup dry roasted peanuts
- 3 1/2 Tbsp kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce)
- 1 1/2 Tbsp palm sugar
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- juice of one lime
- cooked white rice

# Instructions

1. Heat a 12-inch frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and heat.
2. Add all the tempeh and season with kosher salt. Stir to coat, then cook for 2 minutes until brown. Repeat for 12 minutes until all the tempeh is golden brown.
3. Remove the tempeh from the pan and set aside.
4. Set the pan's temperature to medium. Add more oil to the pan. Add the shallots, garlic, chile, and habanero peppers. Season with salt. Cook until shallots and garlic turn color.
5. Add the lemongrass, kaffir lime, and bay leaf. Cook for 1 minute, tossing frequently.
6. Increase the temperature to medium-high. Add the bell peppers and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
7. Add the tempeh and peanuts to the pan. Pour in the sauce. Stir to coat thoroughly.
8. Remove the bay leaf. Stir in the lime juice. Serve.
