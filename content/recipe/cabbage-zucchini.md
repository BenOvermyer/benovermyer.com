This dish is _really_ good. I made it first because I needed to use up half a
cabbage left over from St. Patty's Day.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 head of cabbage, sliced into two-inch ribbons
- 1 zucchini, sliced into one-inch chunks
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 of a white onion, sliced
- 1 cup ricotta
- 1 can butter beans
- 1/2 tbsp thyme
- 1/2 tbsp rosemary
- salt to taste
- 2 tbsp coconut oil

## Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat.
2. Add the garlic to the pan and heat until aromatic.
3. Add the onion to the pan and heat for a few minutes.
4. Add the cabbage to the pan and stir everything.
5. Throw in the thyme, rosemary, and salt. Stir again.
6. Heat for 10 minutes.
7. Add the butter beans.
8. Heat for another 10 minutes or until the cabbage is soft.
9. Add the ricotta and stir until mixed well.
10. Heat for another couple minutes.
