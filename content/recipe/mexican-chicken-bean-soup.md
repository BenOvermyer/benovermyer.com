title = "Mexican-inspired chicken and bean soup"

The original version of this was too thick. I thinned it out with more chicken broth.

# Ingredients

- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 3 serrano peppers, sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp chili powder
- 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can petite diced tomatoes
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups shredded chicken
- juice of 1 lime
- salt and pepper to taste

# Instructions

1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
2. Add the garlic and sautee until fragrant.
3. Add the onion and cook until caramelized.
4. Add the serrano and red bell pepper. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
5. Stir in the cumin and chili powder and cook for an additional minute or two.
6. Add the black beans, pinto beans, diced tomatoes (with juice), and chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.
7. Using an immersion blender, blend half of the soup until smooth. Stir to combine.
8. Stir in the shredded chicken and cook for another 5 minutes.
9. Turn off the heat, stir in the lime juice, and season with salt and pepper to taste.

Garnishes could include cilantro, shredded cheese, or diced avocado.
