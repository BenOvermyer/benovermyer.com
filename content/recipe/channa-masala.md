# Ingredients

-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   3 garlic cloves, minced
-   two 16-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
-   2 teaspoons garam masala
-   1/2 teaspoon turmeric
-   2 teaspoons grated fresh or jarred ginger
-   2 large tomatoes, diced
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice
-   1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro, or to taste
-   salt to taste

# Instructions

1. Heat the oil in a wide skillet. Add the onion and sauté until translucent. Add the garlic and continue to sauté until the onion is golden.
2. Add the chickpeas, garam masala, turmeric, ginger, tomatoes, lemon juice, and about 1/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer, then cook over medium-low heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. This should be moist and stew-like; add a little more water, if needed.
3. Stir in the cilantro and season with salt. Serve on its own in shallow bowls or over a hot cooked grain, if desired.
