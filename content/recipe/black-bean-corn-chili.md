This is my sister's transcription of a recipe for a chili that was served at my parents' restaurant Scotto's
in New Zealand.

# Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 large onion
- 2 medium sweet green peppers
- 1 medium zucchini
- 2 cups frozen corn
- 1-2 tsp. chili powder
- 16 oz can tomatoes
- 15 oz can black beans (2 if desired)
- 8 oz can tomato sauce
- touch of oregano
- 1 can Rotel tomatoes with chili
- 1 canned or fresh jalapeño
- salt and pepper to taste

# Instructions

1. Heat oil in large soup pot.
2. Sautée onion and garlic together until translucent and add green peppers and zucchini, cooking for 2-3 minutes longer.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and let cook for at least 30 minutes. Serve with hot, fresh-baked cornbread and honey, and call it a meal!
