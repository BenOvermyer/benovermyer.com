# Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 lb. uncooked hot Italian sausage (without casings)
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced

# Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Lightly coat a dutch oven with olive oil.
2. Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in a 12-inch pan on medium heat. Add the sausage to the pan and break up with a large spoon. Cook until browned and cooked through.
3. Add the onion, garlic, 1 Tbsp black pepper, and 1/2 tsp kosher salt. Cook until the onion is softened, about 6 minutes.
4. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring, until well-incorporated.
5. Add whole peeled tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands as you add them, and the tomato sauce.
6. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened slightly, about 15 minutes.
7. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the spinach one handful at a time, stirring as you go.
8. Add the white beans and gnocchi. Transfer the mixture to the Dutch oven. Top with the mozzarella, then the Parmesan cheese.
9. Bake until the casserolle is bubbling and the cheese is browned, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.
