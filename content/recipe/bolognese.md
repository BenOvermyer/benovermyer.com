# Instructions

1. In a large dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat oil.
2. Add onion, carrot, and celery, and cook until soft, about 7 minutes.
3. Stir in beef and garlic, breaking up meat with back of a spoon. Cook until no longer pink and lightly seared, about 8 minutes.
4. Add wine, and bring mixture to a simmer. Cook until wine is mostly reduced.
5. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, stock, and bay leaf, then reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour, allowing flavors to meld.
