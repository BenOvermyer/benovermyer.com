# Ingredients

-   1 pound sliced carrots
-   2 tablespoons olive oil
-   2 teaspoons ground coriander, divided
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided
-   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
-   Juice from 1 medium orange (about 1/2 cup)
-   3 cloves garlic, minced
-   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
-   6 ounces arugula
-   1/2 cup [herb tahini dressing](../herb-tahini-dressing)
-   1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds

# Instructions

1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400Â°F.
2. Place the carrots on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the oil; sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the coriander, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper; and toss to evenly coat. Spread into an even layer. Roast, stirring once halfway through, until tender and lightly browned, about 20 minutes total.
3. Meanwhile, place the chickpeas, orange juice, garlic, remaining 1 teaspoon coriander and 1/2 teaspoon salt, and red pepper flakes in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the juice is reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat.
4. Divide the arugula between 4 bowls. Top each bowl with the chickpeas and a spoonful of remaining juice, and the roasted carrots. Drizzle with the dressing and sprinkle with chopped almonds.
