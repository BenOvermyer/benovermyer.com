title = "Greek Bean Soup"

This is my variation of a recipe I found online called "Greek Bean Soup" by user sb2boston.

Honestly I don't know how "Greek" it is. My variation feels more Italian than anything else.

# Ingredients

- 2 cans cannelini beans, drained
- 3 cups mirepoix
- 2 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1 can diced tomatoes
- 1 bunch fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 tbsp dried dill
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 1 tbsp dried basil
- 1 16 oz. container vegetable stock

# Instructions

1. Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil on medium in a large soup pot. Add mirepoix and cook until onions are translucent.
2. Add minced garlic and cook another minute.
3. Add remaining ingredients to pot and add enough water to cover everything by about two inches. Reduce heat and cook for an hour, checking every 20 minutes and adding water as necessary.
4. Add half a cup of olive oil, stir, and serve.
