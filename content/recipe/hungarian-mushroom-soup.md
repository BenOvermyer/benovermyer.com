- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 3 tbsp all-purpose flour

- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp fresh Italian parsley (for garnish)

# Instructions

1. Melt butter in large pot on medium heat.
2. Add onions and mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are translucent (~8 minutes).
3. Add the stock, wine, dill, thyme, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, and salt.
4. Bring to a boil on high heat.
5. Reduce to a simmer on low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes.
