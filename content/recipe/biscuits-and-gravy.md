This recipe is based on my dad's, which in turn is based on a very old Betty Crocker recipe, I think.
I've made a few modifications to suit my own tastes.

The biscuits are just store-bought buttermilk biscuits. Prepare per their instructions.

The recipe for the gravy is as follows.

# Ingredients

-   2 lb. sage ground sausage
-   5 cups whole milk
-   8 tbsp butter
-   Â¾ cup flour
-   a generous amount of black pepper
-   a less generous amount of salt

# Instructions

1. Brown the sausage in a large pan. Remove from heat when done.
2. Melt the butter in a stock pot.
3. Whisk the flour into the butter until a roux is formed.
4. Slowly add the milk to the rue, stirring constantly.
5. Add the sausage, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
6. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.
7. Cook for two minutes, stirring constantly.
