Mysteries of a Broken World was originally a project for Silver Gryphon Games.
When the company folded, I took over development of it as an independent project.
It has languished since then as I worked on other things.

It's meant to be an OSR-inspired game set in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world. As
a work in progress, it will occasionally see updates here.
