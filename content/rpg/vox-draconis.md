title = "Vox Draconis"

Vox Draconis was the first RPG I wrote that ended up online. It was a blatant
rip-off of Dungeons & Dragons Basic, but it had some interesting ideas - like
the setting, and the classes.

I later wrote a supplement for it called Timescape which added time travel and
a description of different time periods for the base game's setting.
