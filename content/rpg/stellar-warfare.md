This is by far the worst RPG I've ever written. It's
based on Star Wars and very obviously the product of a cringeworthy
teenaged mind. I believe I wrote it in 1995, when I was 13.

There are many awful assumptions I made about the Star Wars setting
back then, and the strong attention to "Dark Lords of the Sith" is embarassing.
