Iridium Fantasy was my first attempt at original system design. The name was
a play off of Palladium Fantasy.

While I abandoned this system when I moved to New Zealand, I ended up taking
the setting from it and making a wholly different game out of it. That game
ended up as Ingenium, from Silver Gryphon Games.
