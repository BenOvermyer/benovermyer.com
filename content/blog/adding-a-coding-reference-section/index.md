Today I added a section to the knowledge base portion of this website for [coding languages](/kb/coding). It's meant as a reference for me to refresh my memory when I haven't used a particular language in awhile.

I used ChatGPT to help automate this process so it went faster. It still took me about two hours to add all of the languages. To start with, I've added the languages I'm most familiar with.

More languages might show up in the future if I need them. Each page will expand when and if I need to add a new tidbit of information.
