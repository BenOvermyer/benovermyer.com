November's wellness challenge was a success.

I had no alcohol, despite going out with friends and coworkers multiple
times. It helps that there are several good non-alcoholic beer options these days.
I also kept up the workout regimen. I went to the gym four times a week every
week. The only exception was Thanksgiving Day.

Speaking of Thanksgiving, despite eating normal Thanksgiving dinner (twice), I
only had a brief bump in weight gain. I'm now the lowest weight I've been since
I started tracking in 2019.

I'm planning on continuing the workout regimen and keeping my diet dialed in for
muscle gain and fat loss. This morning I weighed in at 219 lbs. I'm hoping to get
down to 200 lbs. by mid February, but a more realistic goal is 210 lbs. We'll see
where I end up.

I never tried gauging what my one-rep bench press is. I should probably try that
next time I'm at the gym.
