I'm in the process of sunsetting my gemlog. I liked the idea of the Gemini protocol, but it never really grew beyond a specific set of niche topics. Further, it's just easier to write in Markdown, which is what I use for writing this site.

As such, I've migrated all of my gemlog posts into this site.

Here's a list of them:

- [Dune: Awakening - First Impressions](@/blog/dune-awakening-first-impressions/index.md)
- [Awaiting Dune](@/blog/awaiting-dune/index.md)
- [Old and New Experiences](@/blog/old-and-new-experiences/index.md)
- [First Day in Dragonflight](@/blog/first-day-in-dragonflight/index.md)
- [Return to Blizzard](@/blog/return-to-blizzard/index.md)
- [Finished Shadowbringers](@/blog/finished-shadowbringers/index.md)
- [No Man's Sky](@/blog/no-mans-sky/index.md)
