Today’s post is inspired by a challenge from IttyBiz. The author, Naomi Dunford, reflected on how many readers aren’t aware - through no fault of their own - of what we blog writers actually do for a living. So, the challenge was to answer five questions to introduce ourselves (again) to our readers:

# What's your game? What do you do?

By day, I’m a web developer working for a major government contractor. By night, I’m a freelance web designer, artist, and writer.

# Why do you do it? Do you love it, or do you just have one of those creepy knacks?

I love web design. It’s the perfect melding of programming, art, and writing.

# Who are your customers? What kind of people would need or want what you offer?

Most of my clients are game companies. I’ve done artwork or websites for a fair few people as individual commissions too. Usually, the people interested in my services are those looking for a friendly face and an understanding of the game industry that just isn’t there for the majority of web design companies.

# What's your marketing USP? Why should I buy from you instead of the other losers?

I don’t know what a USP is, but I’ll say this - I’m the guy who knows what I’m doing, and I know what my clients are doing too. At the end of the day, I’m a gamer as well as a designer!

# What's next for you? Whats the big plan?

Right now, Mana Trance Creative - the name I do business as a freelancer under - is pretty low on my list of priorities. I take a new client once every three months or so, much reduced from when I was just out of college (and unemployed). However, over the next year I’ll be slowly building up MTC. My goal is to be self-employed at roughly the same standard of living I have now by December of 2009. So, if any of you reading this needs a website (or art) or knows someone who does, shoot me an email!
