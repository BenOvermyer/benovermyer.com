I've been designing games for almost as long as I've been playing them.
I made my first board games in my single digits in the late 80s and early
90s.

My first role-playing games happened a little later, in my early teens.
Thankfully, I kept hard copies of them around. Today I spent some time
transcribing them and recreating their original logos. After putting them
into my standard LaTeX-based manuscript workflow, I produced PDFs of each
of them. Now I've added them to this site. None of them are good, but
they might give you a little insight into where I came from, design-wise.

[Huck Finn: The Role-Playing Game](/rpg/huckfinn): I made this for an English class a long
time ago.

[Stargazer](/rpg/stargazer): This was a weird superhero RPG that gives characters classes based
on their jurisdiction. It includes some strange races.

[Stellar Warfare](/rpg/stellar-warfare): Probably my first RPG ever. It was loosely based on Star Wars,
and reflects a love of space combat and the Dark Side.
