Well, I've been playing Dune: Awakening for about a month now. I joined a guild right away and spent the first few hours after launch exploring and doing early quests ("journeys" in Dune parlance). I spent most of that first day in Discord voice chat with my guild.

I love the game. I've sunk many hours into it already. As expected, I spend most of my time building interesting things and then going out and collecting materials to build more interesting things. I haven't participated in PVP yet, though my guild (Dementium) has some very dedicated PVP players.

The crafting system is fun. The gating of crafting certain items behind acquiring particular resources is well done. I would say I wish they had more available for PVE players but it's not that big a deal to be unable to craft the highest-tier items without a guild's support. You don't really need the highest-tier items unless you're participating in the PVP endgame.

It's still early in the game's life, and that shows. Cheaters are rampant right now, especially in the PVP area, the Deep Desert. I have yet to be personally affected, but it's a little worrying. I have hope that the developers will fix the issue before too long.

Two days ago I built my first assault ornithopter. She's a big beast! I haven't taken her out for more than an initial spin, but I think that'll change when I need to go gather resources in a hard-to-reach spot.

That's it for now. We'll see how long Dune keeps my interest, especially with university starting in a couple months.
