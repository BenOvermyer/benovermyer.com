Last night I was poking around at the [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club) and
discovered a site with a "/currently" page. It's just a little status update along the lines of the old
Livejournal tags. I thought this was clever, so I added something like it to my own site.
