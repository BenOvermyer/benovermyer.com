The last three years have been quite the experience. I'm not really sure how to differentiate between new (and therefore top-of-mind) and old (and therefore more nostalgic/emotional) recollections.

As I write this I'm listening to the soundtrack for Age of Conan, as replayed on a Jellyfin server in my house.

It reminds me of Conan Exiles, which I've spent way more time in than Age of Conan, but which repurposed the soundtrack because it was cheaper than creating new music.

I have fond memories of Final Fantasy XIV. They are not as vivid, lately. But they're more vivid than my memories of Star Wars: Galaxies. SWG was the only game I've devoted creative enterprise to; my most-viewed YouTube video is a SWG video.

Neither game, though, has garnered my attention lately.

I've been spending more of my attention on a game called Reality Break. It's a Diablo-like action RPG where you play as a starship pilot. It has mechanics that feel rewarding.

This seems disingenuous. Current events make video games and other forms of entertainment seem really pointless.
