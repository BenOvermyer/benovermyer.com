The last three years has been a slow, awful death spiral for Blizzard. I don't know
where all the trouble started, though I suspect Activision played a part in it. I
have been playing Blizzard games since the mid-1990s, so with over two decades spent
in their creations, I'm pretty sad to let it all go. I still enjoyed playing Overwatch
for several hours a day.

But now, it's gotten to be too much. The proverbial straw has shattered the camel's
spine.

I uninstalled Overwatch and the Blizzard launcher. They will never return to my computer
unless something truly drastic happens to fix the current state of the company.

Off I go to... something else. Not sure what yet. But something.
