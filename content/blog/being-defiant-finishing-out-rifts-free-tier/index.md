Today is the last day of March and the last day I'll be writing about the MMORPG Rift as it applies to tabletop RPGs. If you've missed any of these posts, you might want to check them out. Go ahead, I'll wait.

This post is a retrospective and has little to do with tabletop RPGs. If you're just looking for new ways to experience your favorite RPG, come back next week – I've got something very interesting planned!

Generally, it takes me about one month to get bored of an MMORPG. I'll steep myself in the lore, powerlevel up to about 75-90% of endgame, get involved in crafting, and then… burn out. The novelty factor wears off, and I stop playing.

Most of the time, it's not a conscious decision to stop playing. I'll just go a day without playing the game, since I find something else I want to do more that one day. Then two days go by. Then three. Before I realize it, it's been over a week since I last logged in, and I have no intention of going back.

A rare handful of MMORPGs keep my interest for longer than that. The list so far has been Star Wars: Galaxies and World of Warcraft. Now, I'm adding Rift to the list.

I originally reinstalled the game because it was going to be free and I'd heard good things about Dimensions. So, I did, and started this blog series to tie the game to tabletop gaming. It just clicked. The novelty factor has worn off, and I'm still playing. That bodes well for its longevity, and I'm going to resubscribe.

The Dimensions are awesome. The fishing is weirdly addictive. And playing an MMO with a great and friendly community is refreshing.

If you're interested in trying it out, jump on the Faeblight server and look me up. I'll be playing either my Eth cleric Amun or my Kelari mage Sidious.
