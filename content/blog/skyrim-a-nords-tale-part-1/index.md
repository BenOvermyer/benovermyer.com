Last night at midnight, I purchased Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim for Xbox 360. This morning I got up at my usual 5:30 and went straight down to the living room to play.

The next few blog posts will be brief updates on my adventures in Skyrim. They'll be out of character, more a log than a story.

<hr />

After a dragon's attack conveniently freed me from captivity and nuked my captors, I was spirited away to a Nord village by a fellow survivor. As a Nord myself, it was interesting to see the culture surrounding the village, and how the villagers reacted to my chosen race as a familiar stranger.

Of the massive arsenal I acquired in the hour or so of play this morning, the weapon I've used the most has been a two-handed battle axe. I loved that I could, straightaway, put the axe on the grindstone and use an iron ingot to turn it into a `[Fine] Battle Axe`. Crafting systems ROCK!

I'm a little overwhelmed by all there is to do. With so many choices and quest givers practically throwing themselves at me, I just shut down and ignored the quests, opting instead to do some exploring. I plan on delving into the inventory/item system next, checking out what I can do in that arena.

I want to see if there's something to these spider eggs I picked up on my flight from the dragon...
