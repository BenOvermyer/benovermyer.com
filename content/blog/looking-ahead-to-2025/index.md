This is going to be a year of big changes.

## Goals for 2025

My goals this year will be primarily setting new habits.

I started guitar lessons in December. I plan to continue practicing
every day, excepting some holidays or travel.

Also on the creative side, I want to develop a painting habit. This
will probably be less frequent than guitar, but I still want to paint
at least once a week.

Continuing from last year's success with going alcohol-free, I will
expand this to make Q1 and Q3 entirely alcohol-free. I expect this
will have positive side effects.

For exercise, I'm getting back on the horse, as it were. I plan on
setting a daily walking habit. I also hope to start jogging again,
and complete at least one 5K.

## Thoughts for 2025

Politically, the USA is likely to experience some upheaval this year.
I hope nothing catastrophic comes of it. We'll see.

While it's not a goal, I'd like to pay more attention to finances this
year and end the year with much more savings.

In 2025 I expect my life to change for the better as I devote myself
to more physical and creative activities, and I'm very much looking
forward to fostering a dog soon.
