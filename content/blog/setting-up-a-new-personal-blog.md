Having a blog built using a static site generator was nice from a maintenance perspective, but from a writing perspective, it's a bit of an inconvenience.

So now I've created a new blog on this address using WordPress. I already use WordPress for the [Silver Gryphon Games](https://silvergryphongames.com) website and I maintain the [Geek Partnership Society](https://geekpartnership.org) website (which also uses WordPress), so I might as well add a third one to the mix.

I will probably migrate all of my existing blog posts to this site. First though I'll need to write a utility to migrate from Hugo to WordPress. That kind of tool doesn't exist yet.
