A few days ago I finished the content for Shadowbringers (the Final Fantasy XIV expansion). Now I'm working on the content that's between that and Endwalker.

Well, that's the vague plan, but I'm also doing other types of content completely unrelated to the main story quest. Like fishing. I enjoy fishing in FFXIV, just like fishing was my primary activity in Animal Crossing when I still played that. I'm not sure why. I don't really like fishing in the real world - it squicks me out.

Auto Pet Battle released a new expansion yesterday, so I'm playing that too. I'm starting to think I should try my hand at creating a single-player video game in the vein of Auto Pet Battle and Monster Train, where order and combos matter.
