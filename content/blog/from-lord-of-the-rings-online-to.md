I canceled my LotRO account, having decided it just wasn't the kind of game experience I'm looking for. While some of the features were interesting and the quest content was phenomenal, other games I've played - like SWG - held my interest for much longer.

So, I'm playing 8 days of a SWG trial with my old account, and I bought Guild Wars. So far, GW is a lot more fun than when I last played. That 5 minutes at a friend's was nothing compared to my current experience.

SWG... well, it remains to be seen whether I'll resub or not. I also bought a copy of D&D Online, as it was on sale, but I probably won't install that until I tire of GW.

More later.
