I've been a vim user for somewhere around 10 years. While I'm comfortable
enough in it, my knowledge and practice of it are still relatively amateurish.
For a long time now I have heard others sing the praises of emacs, and
since I'm trying to expand my horizons, it sounded like a good idea to
try and pick it up.

I'm writing this blog post in emacs. Where possible, emacs is the first
editor that I reach for, even though I know I could accomplish my goals
faster and with less pain if I stuck to what I know. It's an interesting
experience.

I like that emacs is more natural-feeling than vim. The key incantations to
do things are relatively intuitive. However, there is a lot of memorization
I'm going to need to do in order to be effective with it.

This month will be my trial period. By the end of December, I'll have figured
out whether I want to continue using emacs, or switch back to vim.
