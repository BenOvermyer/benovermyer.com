Here we are at November 15, halfway through the wellness challenge that I set for
myself this month. I've kept to it, and while progress has been slow, something
interesting is happening.

I started this challenge at 226 lbs. I'm now down to 221. Also, I'm now past the
"warmup" workout plan and into the first week of the "phase 1" workout plan. This
means I'm going to the gym four days a week instead of three, and alternating between
two workout regimens.

I've settled into a routine now. Going to the gym in the morning is something to
look forward to, rather than a chore to accomplish. That was unexpected.

I may extend the workouts beyond the end of November. This is turning out to be
awesome.
