Early this year, I started applying to universities in Canada for master's degree programs. In March, I was accepted to the Master of Software Engineering program at Memorial University in St. John's, Newfoundland.

From that point forward, we began the planning process for a major life shift. In early July, we gave notice at our jobs, and our long journey to move to Canada became mostly public knowledge. I say "mostly" because I have been very quiet about it online. Until it was a real, for-sure thing and we wouldn't have to pivot, I didn't want to make it known more widely.

Well, on August 8 we crossed the border in Maine and formally got my study permit and Sarah's work permit. We are now officially temporary residents of Canada. Unless something catastrophic happens, we'll be here at least until I finish my degree, which means 2027 at the earliest.

So. That means I will be a university student for the first time since 2007, when I got my bachelor's degree in history at South Dakota State University. This time around, I will be a graduate student.

I'm really excited. I get to reinvent my life and maybe, depending on how I like the academic life, start a new career. At the very least, we get to escape the growing darkness in the United States.
