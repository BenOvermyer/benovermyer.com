My guild, the irreproachable Crescent Order, has seen fit to grace me with a full outfit of custom-crafted light armor and a new cloak. All of it is a verdant hue, with intricate patterns weaved into the cloak. My armor score shot up something like 50 points, heh.

I didn't get around to composing music as I thought I would. I got distracted by SOE reenabling my Star Wars Galaxies account for a trial week. My greatest accomplishment in either game, though, was reaching 13 with Ceolrigan. I didn't spend a lot of time in-game.

That said, a quest that was giving me a lot of trouble - defending a hobbit by name of Constable Bolger from waves of attacking bandits - was finally completed last night. Just as I was about to be defeated again by the bandits, a level 28 guardian came by and killed all of them for me. It was a happy moment, heh. He disappeared before I could thank him properly.
