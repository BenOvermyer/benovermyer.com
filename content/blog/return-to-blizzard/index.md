A few weeks ago, I made the decision to rescind my ban on playing Blizzard games. In part this was because Overwatch 2 was imminent, and I missed the particular style of gameplay that only Overwatch had. But it was also because I know people who work at Blizzard, and boycotting Blizzard games appears to be wholly ineffective at assisting change.

This unlocking of the gate meant several things. I could play Overwatch 1 for one more day before the launch of the "sequel." Overwatch 2 completely replaced the original game, so the first one is gone now. I also needed to preorder the collector's edition of the next WoW expansion if I could. I own every expansion collector's edition - though not the CE for the original game, sadly. That, to my surprise, I accomplished easily by ordering through Blizzard's online store. I wonder if demand is down further than I expected. Finally, I installed the Diablo 2 remake and played it for several hours. I had preordered it prior to my ban, but the ban went into effect before its release.

Now, I've played Overwatch 2 for many hours, and I'm levelling my main in WoW to get ready for the release of the Dragonflight expansion later this month. I have until November 15 to reach level 60, and I'm level 58 now. Should be doable unless I get distracted by other things.
