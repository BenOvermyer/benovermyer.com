Not too long ago, I got fed up with having to use a ton of different apps to do various things online. Also, having to deal with apps that almost-but-not-quite fit the bill for what I was trying to do was a bit frustrating. So, I set out to write my own personal dashboard web app to handle… well, everything. I'm calling it Kettle, mostly because that was the first noun that popped into my head that sounded vaguely appropriate. Does it make sense? Not really. It just sounds right, much like J.R.R. Tolkien loved the sound of the phrase “cellar door.” At the time of this posting, I've just finished the first iteration of the note-taking part of the app. It doesn't yet allow searching or deleting notes, but other than that, it's perfectly usable. You can check it out at the [Kettle repository on GitHub](https://github.com/BenOvermyer/kettle-dashboard).
