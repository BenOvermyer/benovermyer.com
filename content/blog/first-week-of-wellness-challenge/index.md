The first week of my November 2023 wellness challenge went well! Going without
alcohol has given me back a ton of calories I would otherwise have gained, and
I'm feeling more energetic every morning, too.

My first workout was on Wednesday morning at 5:00. It took me a bit to figure out 
where the stations and machines were that I needed for my workout plan. Some things
I had to improvise a bit on; there was no cable row, so I just used the rowing
machine.

My second workout on Friday morning was better. After blundering my way through
the first workout, I took time on Thursday to put together a gym bag. I brought
a log book and made sure to note down what weights I used for each exercise. I
was still a bit sore from Wednesday's workout, but by Saturday morning the soreness
from both sessions was gone.

This week coming up will be the last week of the "warmup plan" specified by my
program. The weeks following will be more involved, and will be four days a week
instead of three.

I've already started to lose a little weight. I'm looking forward to seeing
how far I can get this month.
