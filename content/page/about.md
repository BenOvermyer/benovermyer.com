## Professional Background

I'm a software engineer who loves the web. Not just web technology, mind you; the very idea of the web. Over the last twenty years, it has changed the world. It's my job and my passion to make it better.

I have travelled the world, lived abroad, and usually only ever lived in one place for a couple years. That changed when I moved to Minneapolis. Of all the places I've lived on this globe, Minneapolis has been my favorite. It helps that Minneapolis is turning into a tech hub with a wealth of interesting people doing interesting things with the web.

My particular focus in the professional world is site reliability and systems architecture. Complex systems and their interactions are amazing things.

I started my professional career as a developer, not a system administrator. Now I'm a digital operations manager. I love driving innovation, understanding of systems, and reliability. It's a fascinating domain.
