## Professional Background

I'm a software engineer who loves the web. Not just web technology, mind you; the very idea of the web. Since its inception, it has changed the world. It's my job and my passion to make it better.

I've travelled the world, lived abroad, and usually only ever lived in one place for a couple years at a time. For the moment, I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

My particular focus in the professional world is site reliability and systems architecture. Complex systems and their interactions are amazing things.

I started my professional career as a developer, not a system administrator. Now I'm a "DevOps" engineer. I love driving innovation, understanding of systems, and reliability. It's a fascinating domain.
