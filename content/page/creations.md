## Open Source Projects

I'm particularly interested in procedural generation of fictional worlds. I'm starting to do more of this under the banner of *Iron Arachne*. Here are a few of my projects in that vein:

* [World Generation API](https://github.com/ironarachne/world) World generation API, written in Go.

* [Uncharted Worlds Character Generator](https://github.com/ironarachne/uncharted-worlds-chargen) A character generator for Uncharted Worlds.

* [Name Generator](https://github.com/ironarachne/namegen) A command line name generator.

## Tabletop Games

Over the years I've been involved in tabletop game publications either as an artist, a writer, or both. I've also written a number of games that were never formally published.
