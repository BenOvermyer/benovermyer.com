## Open Source Projects

I'm particularly interested in procedural generation of fictional worlds. I'm starting to do more of this under the banner of _Iron Arachne_. Here are a few of my projects in that vein:

-   [Iron Arachne](https://gitlab.com/ironarachne/ironarachne): My world generation site, and my main personal project.
-   [Uncharted Worlds Character Generator](https://gitlab.com/ironarachne/uncharted-worlds-chargen): A character generator for Uncharted Worlds.
-   [Name Generator](https://github.com/ironarachne/namegen): A command line name generator written in Go.

## Tabletop Games

Over the years I've been involved in tabletop game publications either as an artist, a writer, or both. I've also written a number of games that were never formally published.

### Non-Commercial RPGs

These are role-playing games that I never published in any commercial sense. They're just free books you can download here.

-   [Vox Draconis](/games/voxdraconis.pdf) (1997) - My first RPG to be made publicly available.
-   [Vox Draconis: Timescape](/games/timescape.pdf) (1997) - A time-travel and lore supplement for Vox Draconis.
-   [Iridium Fantasy](/games/iridiumfantasy.pdf) (1998) - My first attempt at system design.
-   [Mysteries of a Broken World](/games/mysteriesofabrokenworld.pdf) - This is a work in progress. It was begun in 2018 and meant to be a Silver Gryphon Games product before SGG went under.
-   [Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire](/page/voxdraconisksf) - This is a work in progress. It's a new RPG, written with over twenty years of game design experience behind me.
