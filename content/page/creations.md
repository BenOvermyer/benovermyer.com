## Open Source Projects

I'm particularly interested in procedural generation of fictional worlds. I'm starting to do more of this under the banner of *Iron Arachne*. Here are a few of my projects in that vein:

* [Heraldry Generator](https://gitlab.com/ironarachne/heraldry) Heraldry generator, written in Go. Also a library for the same.

* [Uncharted worlds Character Generator](https://github.com/ironarachne/uncharted-worlds-chargen) A character generator for Uncharted Worlds.

* [Name Generator](https://github.com/ironarachne/namegen) A command line name generator.

## Tabletop Games

Over the years I’ve released a variety of books, articles, and other documents into the wild. Some of these were published in the true print sense, and some were only released online.

These are listed in reverse chronological order. Where possible, I included a link to the most recent publicly available version.
