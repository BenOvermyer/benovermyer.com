I'm working on a new tabletop role-playing game. It's the spiritual successor to _Vox Draconis_, 
a game I wrote when I was a teenager way back in the 1990s.

The guiding philosophies behind this game are the following:

* There are no monsters, only perceptions
* The whimsy of mash-up settings is something missing from today's RPGs
* People are collections of past experiences and ancestries, and not cookie-cutter clich√©s
* Math sucks
* Choices are awesome
* Stories are better

You can download the work-in-progress rules here: [Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire PDF](/vox-draconis-ksf.pdf)

Once the game is in a more finished state, I intend to publish it on DriveThruRPG as a print-on-demand title.
