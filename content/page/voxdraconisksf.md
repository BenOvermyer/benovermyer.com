I'm working on a new tabletop role-playing game. It's the spiritual successor to _Vox Draconis_,
a game I wrote when I was a teenager way back in the 1990s.

The guiding philosophies behind this game include the following:

-   There are no monsters, only perceptions
-   The whimsy of mash-up settings is missing from today's RPGs
-   People are collections of past experiences and ancestries, and not cookie-cutter clich√©s
-   Complex math sucks
-   Choices are awesome
-   Stories give meaning to rules

You can download the work-in-progress rules here: [Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire PDF](/vox-draconis-ksf.pdf)

This document is updated periodically as I work on it more. It was last updated October 22nd, 2020.

Once the game is in a more finished state, I intend to publish it on DriveThruRPG as a print-on-demand title.
