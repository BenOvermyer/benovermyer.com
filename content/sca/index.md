title = "Godric Alburne of the SCA"
description = "Information about my persona in the Society for Creative Anachronism"
+++

I originally joined the [Society for Creative Anachronism](https://www.sca.org)
in the late 2000s while a student at South Dakota State University.

I spent time as a fighter, an herald, and a webminister. I served as the kingdom
submissions herald for Northshield and trained to be a marshal. Then, I took an
extended break from the SCA starting around 2014 or so.

After moving to North Carolina in 2022, I joined the kingdom of Atlantia as part
of the Shire of Seareach. I took up the mantle of webminister for the shire.
This is when I finally registered my own device.

However, the timing didn't feel right, and so I left again.

Below is my persona and Order of Precedence.
