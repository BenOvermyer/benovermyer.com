I work on a number of different software projects. Most of them are open source.

I'm particularly interested in procedural generation of fictional worlds. I'm starting to do more of this under the banner of _Iron Arachne_. Here are a few of my projects in that vein:

-   [Iron Arachne](https://gitlab.com/ironarachne/iron-arachne-js): This site is my primary project. It's a collection of generators for tabletop role-playing games. It's written in JavaScript using Vue.js. Previous iterations were written in [PHP](https://gitlab.com/ironarachne/ironarachne) and [Go](https://gitlab.com/ironarachne/world).
-   [Name Generator](https://github.com/ironarachne/namegen): A command line name generator written in Go.
