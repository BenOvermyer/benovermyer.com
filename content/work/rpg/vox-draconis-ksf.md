This is the spiritual successor to _Vox Draconis_, a game I wrote when I was a teenager way back in the 1990s.

The guiding philosophies behind this game include the following:

- There are no monsters, only perceptions
- People are collections of past experiences and ancestries, and not cookie-cutter clich√©s
- Complex math sucks
- Choices are awesome
- Stories give meaning to rules
- "Nothing happens" feels awful
