After years of using a CSS framework for my site, I've now dropped it entirely.

Inspired by the movement to reduce the filesize and cruft of websites that have no need
for graphics or heavy JavaScript, I decided to cut out as much as possible. This started
a few months ago with removing my web fonts and replacing them with system fonts.

Today, I removed [Bulma](https://bulma.io) from my site. I opted instead for the most basic
CSS I could. I still write it as SCSS, and I rely on several CSS3 features, but the file size
has dropped dramatically. So has the load time.

This may be just a phase, but for now, I'm really enjoying the new minimal aesthetic.
