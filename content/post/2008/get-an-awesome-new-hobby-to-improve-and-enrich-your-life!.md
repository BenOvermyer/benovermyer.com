Balancing a frugal life with a fun life can be difficult. Many hobbies
and forms of entertainment cost money, and some are more expensive than
others. Some hobbies - like yachting - are prohibitively expensive for
the average joe. Others, like hiking, are practically free in the right
circumstances. Choosing fun hobbies that don't hit up the wallet too
hard can be a great way to reduce living expenses while still letting
you lead the life you want.

Choosing a new hobby is a simple process, though some of the details can
require a lot of thought. Follow the next few steps to gain a new,
cheaper, more exciting handle on life!

-   **Consider the cost.** Cheaper is better, but there are multiple
    angles to think about. Entry cost is only one part of the equation.
    There are also incidental costs (like, say, the cost of buying more
    paintballs), maintenance costs (repairing your hiking boots), and
    upgrade costs (like getting more involved in the hobby's
    community). Cost is not necessarily monetary, remember! It can
    involve significant time and social commitments.
-   **Think about your overarching interests.** Are you a nature lover?
    An athlete? Do you like making things? How about challenging
    yourself? Thinking about these things will get your mind working on
    the possibilities.
-   **Favor physical activities over sedentary ones.** Being physically
    active is much better for you. Mental growth is important too, but
    if you're used to sitting at home, opt for the physical new hobby
    over the mental one.
-   **Make a list.** Considering the first three steps, do some research
    on fun activities that might match your interests. Don't just rely
    on Google, either; check out the local library and review your
    options in your home town. Some cities have extensive bike trails,
    while others might have public tennis courts. See what's available.
-   **Narrow the list.** Pick two options from it, and try out both. Go
    with the one that seems more fun to you after a month or so. Enjoy
    your new hobby! Spend a lot of time with it. Hobbies can stagnate
    and become boring if you don't engage them often, so try and
    dedicate specific blocks of time to it every week.

Don't worry about retiring old, expensive hobbies. Just devote a decent
chunk of time to your new hobby, and if you enjoy it, you'll find that
your other hobbies won't seem as important and will fade in
time...along with those expensive side costs that accompanied them!
