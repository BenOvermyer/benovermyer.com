Today's post is inspired by a challenge from IttyBiz. The author, Naomi
Dunford, reflected on how many readers aren't aware - through no fault
of their own - of what we blog writers actually do for a living. So, the
challenge was to answer five questions to introduce ourselves (again) to
our readers:

What‚Äôs your game? What do you do? {#whatsyourgamewhatdoyoudo}
-----------------------------------

By day, I'm a web developer working for a major government contractor.
By night, I'm a freelance web designer, artist, and writer.

Why do you do it? Do you love it, or do you just have one of those creepy knacks? {#whydoyoudoitdoyouloveitordoyoujusthaveoneofthosecreepyknacks}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I love web design. It's the perfect melding of programming, art, and
writing.

Who are your customers? What kind of people would need or want what you offer? {#whoareyourcustomerswhatkindofpeoplewouldneedorwantwhatyouoffer}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of my clients are game companies. I've done artwork or websites
for a fair few people as individual commissions too. Usually, the people
interested in my services are those looking for a friendly face and an
understanding of the game industry that just isn't there for the
majority of web design companies.

What‚Äôs your marketing USP? Why should I buy from you instead of the other losers? {#whatsyourmarketinguspwhyshouldibuyfromyouinsteadoftheotherlosers}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't know what a USP is, but I'll say this - I'm the guy who knows
what I'm doing, and I know what my clients are doing too. At the end of
the day, I'm a gamer as well as a designer!

What‚Äôs next for you? What‚Äôs the big plan? {#whatsnextforyouwhatsthebigplan}
---------------------------------------------

Right now, Mana Trance Creative - the name I do business as a freelancer
under - is pretty low on my list of priorities. I take a new client once
every three months or so, much reduced from when I was just out of
college (and unemployed). However, over the next year I'll be slowly
building up MTC. My goal is to be self-employed at roughly the same
standard of living I have now by December of 2009.

So, if any of you reading this needs a website (or art) or knows someone
who does, shoot me an email!
