It seems that lately more companies are veering towards non-uniformity
in system design. Employees are allowed to use any computer they want,
as long as certain key criteria (e.g., ability to get onto the company
intranet) are met. [Google has taken this
approach](http://www.cio.com/article/144500/IT_s_Third_Epoch...and_Running_IT_at_Google/2),
and I imagine it'd be a good thing for Gen Y to universally follow
Google's lead.

With the creep towards distributed computing once again, we could even
have "[mobile dumb
terminals](http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/04/13/time-for-a-portable-dumb-terminal/)"
without too much effort or complication.

So, with all that in mind, let's hear what you think about this. Should
companies allow their employees to use whatever computer they want?
