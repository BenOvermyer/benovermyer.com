I spent the past month playing World of Warcraft with my fianc√©e and Star Wars Galaxies with the IA. WoW is actually fun now that I’ve stopped trying to just gain levels. I think the QuestHelper add-on helps…it makes questing a lot easier, and reduces the amount of down time I have. That, and my fiancee’s advice to only do yellow quests and to abandon green ones immediately. However, as of Friday I’ve started a month-long experiment in fitness and finance, and part of it is the temporary cancellation of both of my MMO subscriptions. Catch you in 30!
