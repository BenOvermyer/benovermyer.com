I spent the past month playing World of Warcraft with my fianc√©e and
Star Wars Galaxies with the IA. WoW is actually fun now that I've
stopped trying to just gain levels. I think the QuestHelper add-on
helps...it makes questing a lot easier, and reduces the amount of down
time I have. That, and my fianc√©e's advice to only do yellow quests
and to abandon green ones immediately.

However, as of Friday I've started a month-long experiment in fitness
and finance, and part of it is the temporary cancellation of both of my
MMO subscriptions. Catch you in 30!
