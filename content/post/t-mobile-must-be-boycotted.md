Normally, I don't post more than once a week. However, after reading
about [T-Mobile's assault on Net
Neutrality](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2007/12/t-mobile-attack.html)
on Wired, I had to blog about it.

T-Mobile wants to tell you what websites you can visit. We should tell
T-Mobile what it can do with its Terms of Service....and take our money
elsewhere.
