Three years ago, I was working on the last project I would touch at Silver Gryphon Games.
It was an old-school revival game called _Mysteries of a Broken World_. It was meant to
be a fantasy post-apocalyptic game and cleave close to the design paradigms of OSR:

- Simple rules
- Pulpy settings
- Brutal combat

I wrote several blog articles on my now-defunct Accio Inspirante blog about the game. After
Silver Gryphon Games met its end, I forgot it even existed. This morning while cleaning up
some things in my WordPress.com account I noticed Accio Inspirante and took a look around.
On the principle that I'm collecting all of my works in one place, I moved all of the blog
posts from there into this site. You can read them here:

* [Designing a New OSR Game]({{< ref "../2018/designing-a-new-osr-game" >}})
* [Designing an OSR Game Part 2: Freeholds and Fatality]({{< ref "../2018/designing-an-osr-game-part-2" >}})
* [Designing an OSR Game Part 3: Names, Backgrounds, and Playtests]({{< ref "../2018/designing-an-osr-game-part-3" >}})
* [Designing an OSR Game Part 4: Alignment, Treasure, and Exploration]({{< ref "../2018/designing-an-osr-game-part-4" >}})

When I took a look at the manuscript for _Mysteries of a Broken World_, it was in quite the state.
I converted it from Markdown to LaTeX, like I've done for Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire
and for Ingenium Second Edition. While I was converting it, I saw a lot that I liked about the
system.

I added Mysteries to my in-progress games. The PDF is available on the Creations page if you want
to see what it's like. I'll continue working on it alongside VD:KSF and I2E.
