Recently I canceled my paid hosting and relinquished control of
benovermyer.com and manatrance.com, my two domain names. Up until now,
these served as the primary way to reach me on the web.

Once I decided to relinquish all control of my finances, however, I
purged everything I had a subscription or recurring payment to. The only
exceptions to this were necessary services like electricity, water,
phone service, and so on, and also the World of Warcraft Annual Passes
that we contracted into.

This move was in no small part motivated by my increasing adoption of
the world view of Leo Babauta over at [Zen
Habits](http://www.zenhabits.net/). By removing my ability to
impulse-buy, I get rid of a major distraction. This is just the first
step in a plan to greatly increase my hummingbird-like attention span.

Every so often, I'll post an update on this process.
