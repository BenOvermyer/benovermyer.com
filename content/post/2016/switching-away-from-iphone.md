Yesterday I went on the Google Fi site and signed up for a Nexus 6P and
a data plan roughly equivalent to what I spend at Verizon. My iPhone 6
Plus, despite not (yet) being paid off, is going to sit in a drawer
collecting dust starting late next week when the Nexus arrives. Am I
displeased with the iPhone? No, not especially. Am I unhappy with
Verizon? Well yeah, that's kind of a given for any Verizon customer. I
have personal reasons for needing a new phone on a new carrier, but I
also have a professional interest in Google Fi and the way it handles
mobile phones. We'll see where this goes.
