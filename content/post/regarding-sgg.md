In late 2014, I stepped down from my role at Silver Gryphon Games. I had too much going on in my life to properly pay attention to the company.

In early 2017, I felt I had sorted out enough that I could return, and so I did. I hadn't returned with the kind of rigor that a dormant company needs to be successful, though, and 2017 was largely a wash as far as SGG was concerned.

Last Tuesday I met with the other co-founder Kevin online. We discussed what was necessary to bring the company back from the dead. I was adamant about getting our undelivered Kickstarter project completed and delivered. We established a weekly recurring meeting and I set up a kanban board in Trello to track work in progress.

This is probably more effort than SGG has seen in years as far as planning goes. For the first time since 2014, I feel like SGG has a shot at being successful.

Our focus is going to be on clearing our pre-existing backlog. While Kevin and I have always been good at idea generation, we've been less successful at follow-through, and that's where I want us to shine this year.
