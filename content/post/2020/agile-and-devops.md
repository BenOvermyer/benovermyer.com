Over the last nineteen years, much has been written (and rewritten) about
the practice of "Agile." Most of that has been about Scrum and the delivery
of software. In the last few years, businesses have increasingly tried to
apply Scrum-Agile to every facet of their operation - not just software
development. This includes the practice of DevOps.

First, I'll set out some definitions. DevOps formally refers to the union
of development and operations and the breaking down of barriers between all
elements of a business. It has a secondary and more common definition of
the engineering discipline whereby an engineer manages the software operations
of a business through automation, monitoring, and operations-focused software
development. For the purposes of this article, I'm going to use this second
definition.

Agile can mean several things. Often, it's used as shorthand for a formalized
implementation of the Agile Manifesto called Scrum. It also can just refer to
a vague notion of time-limited work scheduling. For this article, I'm going
to define Agile as a practice generally adhering to the Agile Manifesto.
