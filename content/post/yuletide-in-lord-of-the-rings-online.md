I haven’t had a chance to play LotRO much lately because of the holidays, but yesterday I managed to get on for awhile. I trekked from west of Bree to the Shire, partly finishing a quest for Celandine Brandybuck in the process. The Shire is an amazing location and I love exploring it. The sights are fascinating…especially the Hill and the surrounding environs there. The plots of a certain ill-meaning hobbit up that way came to my attention, and of course I did something about it.

The end result was I finished a level 1 quest chain with a very entertaining storyline and got a Yule Tree yard decoration for my efforts.

If anyone hasn’t done this quest yet, I highly recommend it. Lots of fun!
