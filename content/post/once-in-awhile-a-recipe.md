Today, I'm going to do something a little different. I had a post about
chivalry and conscience nearly complete, but instead I think I'll
present something a little lighter....a recipe, and its origins.

Called "Watergate Salad," it's not really a salad in the traditional
sense. Since I'm not feeling too well, my girlfriend made up a batch
for me. It's not healthy in any sense, but it does indulge my sweet
tooth!

Here's the recipe:

Watergate Salad {#watergatesalad}
---------------

-   1 can (15.5-20 oz) crushed pineapple
-   1/2 bag mini-marshmallows
-   1/2 tub light Cool Whip (or similar)
-   1 package instant pistachio pudding (I prefer Jello brand)

Just mix all ingredients together and serve! Must be refrigerated and
covered for storage.

Watergate salad is a variation on "ambrosia salad," a dessert dish
that appears to have originated sometime during the 19th century in
southern America. Some sources place its starting point at somewhere
around 1830, although given the wildly divergent recipes floating around
both then and now, it's likely that it never had any single inventor or
point of origin.

Another blogger who has [posted this
recipe](http://dorcasannettewalker.blogspot.com/2006/12/watergate-salad.html),
Dorcas Walker, has some more information and, in her comments, some
variations you can try.

This recipe is great for parties. The next time you drop by
[SXSW](http://sxsw.com/), bring a carload of it and you'll be an
instant celebrity!
