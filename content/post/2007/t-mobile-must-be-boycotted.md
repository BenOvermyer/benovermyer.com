Normally, I don’t post more than once a week. However, after reading about [T-Mobile’s assault on Net Neutrality](http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2007/12/t-mobile-attack.html) on Wired, I had to blog about it. T-Mobile wants to tell you what websites you can visit. We should tell T-Mobile what it can do with its Terms of Service….and take our money elsewhere.
