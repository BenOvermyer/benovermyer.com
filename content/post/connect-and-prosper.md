Something missing in a lot of big companies - whether office, factory,
or what-have-you - is a sense of community and connectedness. There is
frequently no connection between You and the Team. In the case of
freelancers, it's between You and the Client.

What do I mean by connection? I mean empathy. I mean that feeling you
get when you really understand someone, and they understand you.
There's way too much focus on Lone Wolf, out-for-number-one tactics out
there.

I recently read [Connection Culture by Michael Lee
Stallard](http://changethis.com/44.06.ConnectionCulture) and found
myself nodding at every third paragraph. Michael's research is
impeccable and his findings are both simple and profound. He goes into
great detail about the hows and whys of connecting at the workplace. His
conclusions are that A) connections at work make that company a great
place to work for, and B) in the case of customers and clients, that
company becomes a great one to do business with. People are happier when
they're connected.

Michael doesn't go too much into scale and volume, but he does make
notable mention of the fact that big companies that encourage
communication and connection do demonstrably better work, backed up by
trustworthy data.

According to his research and my own personal experiences, people who
make connections are happier, healthier, more optimistic, and generally
more energetic than those who do not.

So.

When's the last time you made an effort to make connections in your
workplace? Do you know the name of the guy in the cubicle across the
way? If not, introduce yourself. Get to know the people you work with,
for, and above, and you will find that the rewards greatly outweigh any
remotely possible cost to yourself.
