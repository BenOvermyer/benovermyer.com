Took off a day early so I could get to Madison, WI at a leisurely pace. I’m sitting in the hotel room writing this. This is my first trip to Madison, and my route took me through an interesting set of neighborhoods. The layout is definitely not as easy to navigate as Minneapolis’s, though it had a cozier quality to it. The roads are narrower and twist and turn more.

I’m fairly certain I saw Ed Greenwood entering the hotel just after me, but by the time I got checked in and looked around for him, he was gone. Ah well, I’ll see him tomorrow.

I plan on blogging every day of the con. We’ll see what adventures are in store.
