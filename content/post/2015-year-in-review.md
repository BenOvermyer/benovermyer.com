2015 was a year of big changes for me. The biggest was starting on the
path to divorce and moving into my own apartment. For the first time in
my life, I'm living completely on my own. That feels very different,
and very exciting. I also had my first anxiety attack earlier in the
year. Since then, while I haven't had any more, I've definitely felt
more anxious and vulnerable than before. This is strange, since prior to
the attack, I always felt like I didn't worry about anything. I'm
still mystified as to why it happened. Continuing the health-related
theme, in December I noticed that I had lost ten pounds since the last
time I'd been weighed. I chalked it up to my new method of commuting
since moving into the apartment - walking to work. I'm not convinced
that was completely the case anymore, but it was probably a big
contributor. The holidays erased half of that loss, but eh, I can
recover from that. I established a habit of doing push-ups every morning
after waking, I'm working on my nutrition, and I joined Bodyspace, a
fitness social networking run by Bodybuilding.com. At work, I went from
being sole operations engineer on a legacy platform to lead operations
engineer on a team that helped launched a brand-new platform to, in
October, digital operations manager. Granted, I'm a "working
manager," and still spend a lot of time on the engineering side of
things. Starting in November, I began budgeting in earnest. I'm much
more aware of where my money is going and for the first time in well
over a decade I feel in control of my finances. I've kept it up, and by
this point I think budgeting has become a daily habit. 2015 was very
stressful. 2016 seems full of promise and I'm very optimistic about the
future. Here's to a year of health and personal growth!
