A few days ago, I migrated all of my blog posts from my last primary
blog on WordPress.com to this blog. In the process, I read over a lot of
old posts. I noticed something interesting: back in 2007 and 2008, I was
writing blog posts with fair regularity. Now, it's a rarity.

The blog posts back then were fairly journal-like in character. They
told a story of what I was working on, how I felt on certain subjects,
and described some of my adventures in games I was playing at the time.

The blog posts I wrote in the recent past trend towards the same thing
when they're more frequent. When I choose to try and write something
*useful*, like the Laravel on Docker post, it takes a lot longer, a lot
more effort, and is a lot more intimidating to start on.

So as I sit here sipping on my orange pekoe black tea, listening to
relaxing acoustic guitar, and writing these words, I'm thinking that I
should allow myself to write journal-style posts again.

This, if for no other reason than to ingrain that old writing habit.
It'll be easier to write the big, important stuff if the simple stuff -
the writing - comes naturally, right?
