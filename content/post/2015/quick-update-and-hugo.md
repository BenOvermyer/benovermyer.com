Well, it’s been about two months since my last post, which ironically was about my intention to write more frequently. To be fair, I wrote in my journal a number of times between then and now, but this is my first public post since then. Today I discovered a Go-based static site generator called [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io/) that fascinates me with its speed and usability. I’m going to try using it to replace the current structure and content of [benovermyer.com](http://benovermyer.com).
