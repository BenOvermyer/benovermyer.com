After a full year of not playing, yesterday I jumped back into World of
Warcraft. I'd heard enough good things about the latest changes that I
decided to give it another shot.

It remains to be seen whether that'll last or not.

Something that did make me pause, though, is the obvious reminder that
WoW is based on a gear grind. As soon as my character, a [worgen warlock
named
Exsecratus](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/kelthuzad/Exsecratus/simple),
made it to the new continent, I almost immediately replaced my raid epic
gear from the Cataclysm days with greens. Today's junk is better than
yesterday's hard-won treasure.

That theme carries across many modern MMORPGs, but in all honesty, it's
also present in tabletop RPGs these days. Dungeons & Dragons is one of
the worst culprits, but there are plenty of others. That got me to
thinking.

Is the gear grind necessarily bad? The perpetual need to have better
equipment may seem like a thin excuse to keep people playing a game, but
taken as a component of a larger and more complex system, it's a
reliable foundation to build on.

In a game like [my own
Ingenium](http://silvergryphongames.com/games/Ingenium/), where if you
have too many static modifiers it makes the randomization provided by
the dice useless, a gear grind based on incremental bonus increases
wouldn't make much sense.

However, if there were a game out there that had more complex
calculation involved with point bonuses, then having a Sword +513
wouldn't necessarily be any more unbalanced than a Sword +3. The trick
is that to get to that level, you need to involve multiplication and
division in the core mechanic, and that's the real holdup for a
tabletop RPG.

Let's face it - most tabletop gamers don't want to sit and recalculate
their stats every time they pick up a new item. In video games it's
possible because the game itself handles it automatically in the
background without the player even being aware of the math.

To introduce infinitely-scaling item stats into a tabletop RPG, you
would have to do one of two things - either create a phone/tablet app to
handle the math for you, or make the math so simplified that it would be
possible to calculate quickly.

Being a web developer by profession, I'm partial to the first one.
These days it's not unreasonable to expect gamers to have a smartphone.

How would you handle bringing the gear grind into a tabletop game?
