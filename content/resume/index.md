The chief aim of any web technologist is to make a particular part of the web more awesome for people. Or at least, it should be. The web was built for people. For my part, I now act as a senior platform engineer and tech lead. I'm responsible for building out performant and highly-available digital infrastructure and guiding others in this discipline. The challenge of the continually-evolving domain of internet infrastructure drives me to always be learning, testing, and sharing that new knowledge.

**Specialties:** AWS infrastructure, high availability, continuous deployment, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, IT project management, the DevOps and Unix philosophies, knowledge sharing, leading effective teams, automation

**Preferred Programming Languages:** Go, Python, Typescript, PHP

**Ancillary Skills:** Team engagement, identifying and instrumenting key application metrics, tailoring communication of important information to different audiences
