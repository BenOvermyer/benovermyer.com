This is a list of all the things that I use to be productive day-to-day. It's inspired by [this page](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses).

# Hardware

## Alienware Aurora R11

I bought a dedicated gaming PC after I missed gaming too much on my Mac. For a long time I used Windows, but when I "upgraded" to Windows 11, I ran into too many issues and replaced it with Pop_OS! as my sole operating system. However, while most games ran fine in Proton, I ran into a few that had severe problems. One of them would automatically ban your user account if it detected you were using Linux.

So, now I'm on Windows 10.

## 2019 MacBook Pro 16"

I replaced my old Windows/Linux custom-built PC with this on July 22nd, 2020. For a time I used it both for development and for gaming, but I missed my favorites too much. Now it's used exclusively for development and for travel.

## Logitech MX Keys

**Website:** [Logitech MX Keys](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-keys-wireless-keyboard.920-009295.html)

I use this keyboard for my Macbooks. It's great for quickly switching between them.

## Steelseries Apex Pro Keyboard

**Website:** [Steelseries Apex Pro](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-pro)

This keyboard has a beautiful aesthetic, sturdy construction, and a typefeel that I just adore. It's great for gaming and typing.

## Dell S3220DGF 32" 2K monitor

**Website:** [Dell 32 Curved Gaming Monitor - S3220DGF](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-curved-gaming-monitor-s3220dgf/apd/210-atyt/monitors-monitor-accessories)

I replaced my old ultrawidescreen monitor with this. It has a more common aspect ratio, a more stable stand, and much better refresh rate. Besides that, it also "announces" itself properly, meaning that macOS actually recognizes its capabilities. I have three of them - one for my Mac, one for my work Mac, and one for my gaming PC.

## Beautyrest Platinum Sofil Bonded Leather Executive Chair

**Website:** [Beautyrest Platinum Sofil Bonded Leather Executive Chair, Black (49404B)](https://www.staples.com/beautyrest-platinum-sofil-bonded-leather-executive-chair-black-49404b/product_24381184)

I replaced my DXRacer King Zero in March of 2022 with this chair. It's cheaper and more comfortable than the DXRacer was. The cats have already made a number of holes in the faux-leather, though.

# Lifestyle Software

## Firefox

I've changed browsers frequently over the years. Now I seem to have settled on Firefox.

## Spotify

I use Spotify for streaming music and building playlists. If I can't find it on Spotify, I usually need to turn
to self-hosting on Jellyfin.

# Design Software

## Affinity Suite

I switched back to Affinity after not using Adobe for months. The Adobe early termination fee reinforced why I don't want to use Adobe software.

# Development Software

## Sublime Text

**Website:** [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

In November 2022 I finally bought a license for Sublime Text. I've been using it as my daily driver for months now.

## VSCode

**Website:** [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I still use VSCode for a lot of things. While Sublime Text is faster and cleaner, VSCode has more features.

# Hosting and Infrastructure Services

## Namecheap

**Website:** [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

I've heard that other domain registrars are better (e.g., [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)), but I host almost all of my domains at Namecheap because it works well enough.

## Hetzner

**Website:** [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/)

I use a Hetzner VPS for most of my hosting these days.

## Cloudflare

**Website:** [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)

I use Cloudflare for my DNS management. I don't use it as a CDN anymore, though it works well for that purpose.

# Search Engine

**Website:** [Kagi](https://kagi.com)

I use (and pay for) Kagi.
