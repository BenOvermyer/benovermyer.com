This is a list of all the things that I use to be productive day-to-day. It's inspired by [this page](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses).

## Hardware

### Steelseries Apex Pro Keyboard

**Website:** [Steelseries Apex Pro](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-pro)

This keyboard has a beautiful aesthetic, sturdy construction, and a typefeel that I just adore. It's great for gaming
and typing.

### Viotek GN34C 34" Ultrawidescreen Monitor

**Website:** [Viotek GN34C](https://viotek.com/viotek-gn34cx-34-ultrawide-qhd-curved-professional-monitor-100hz-219-freesync/)

Though some games don't support 3440x1440 resolution, I've found this to be excellent for coding and for graphics editing
capabilities. Also, watching movies on this thing is awesome.

### DXRacer King Zero gaming chair

**Website:** [DXRacer King Zero](https://www.dxracer.com/au/en-au/product/1/gaming-chair/king-series/oh-kf00-nr-zero/)

After many years of living with a barely-intact office chair I bought for $5 at Goodwill, I bought a DXRacer King Zero gaming
chair. It was a night and day experience. So comfortable! Mine is sunburst yellow and black.

## Lifestyle Software

### Firefox

**Website:** [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/)

This is my web browser of choice. While sometimes I'm forced to use Brave, I try to avoid anything
Chromium-based if I can help it.

## Design Software

### Affinity Photo

**Website:** [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/)

My replacement for Photoshop. It's pretty good, and while my Photoshop muscle memory doesn't translate
perfectly, its buy-once model combined with its feature set makes it the better alternative.

### Affinity Designer

**Website:** [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/)

Same story as Photo, but this one replaces Adobe Illustrator. The one difference is that I reach for
Inkscape when I need to trace raster graphics.

### Affinity Publisher

**Website:** [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/publisher/)

Same story as Photo, but this one replaces Adobe InDesign. It's still new enough to have some issues and
there are features missing, but it works well enough for laying out books and such.

## Development Software

### Visual Studio Code

**Website:** [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Though I switched back to Sublime Text for a time due to its speed, I had to come back to VSCode for
light code editing owing to its robust plugin ecosystem.

### GoLand

**Website:** [Jetbrains GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)

I write a lot of Go. And by far the best tool for writing Go has been GoLand.

### PHPStorm

**Website:** [Jetbrains PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)

When I write PHP, this is the IDE I use most.

## Hosting and Infrastructure Services

### Namecheap

**Website:** [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

I've heard that other domain registrars are better (e.g., [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)), but I host almost all of my domains
at Namecheap because it works well enough.

### Digital Ocean

**Website:** [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

Digital Ocean is the infrastructure provider I use for all of my personal projects. It's cheaper than
AWS, Azure, or GCP, the tooling is really good, and the community is fantastic.

### Netlify

**Website:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Netlify hosts this website, and a handful of other static sites. It's free and works really well.
