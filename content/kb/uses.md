This is a list of all the things that I use to be productive day-to-day. It's inspired by [this page](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses).

# Hardware

## 2019 MacBook Pro 16"

I replaced my old Windows/Linux custom-built PC with this on July 22nd, 2020. Since then, it's been amazing. Though I had to give up some gaming capability, the tradeoff is that everything else is worlds better. Having 32 GB of RAM certainly helps matters.

## Steelseries Apex Pro Keyboard

**Website:** [Steelseries Apex Pro](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-pro)

This keyboard has a beautiful aesthetic, sturdy construction, and a typefeel that I just adore. It's great for gaming and typing.

## Dell S3220DGF 32" 2K monitor

**Website:** [Dell 32 Curved Gaming Monitor - S3220DGF](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-curved-gaming-monitor-s3220dgf/apd/210-atyt/monitors-monitor-accessories)

I replaced my old ultrawidescreen monitor with this. It has a more common aspect ratio, a more stable stand, and much
better refresh rate. Besides that, it also "announces" itself properly, meaning that macOS actually recognizes its capabilities.

## DXRacer King Zero gaming chair

**Website:** [DXRacer King Zero](https://www.dxracer.com/au/en-au/product/1/gaming-chair/king-series/oh-kf00-nr-zero/)

After many years of living with a barely-intact office chair I bought for $5 at Goodwill, I bought a DXRacer King Zero gaming chair. It was a night and day experience. So comfortable! Mine is sunburst yellow and black.

Lately it's been wearing out. It's developed a wobble, and the fake leather is perpetually flaking off now. A new chair is on the horizon.

# Lifestyle Software

## Microsoft Edge, Brave, and Safari

OK, this is complicated. On Windows I use Edge as my preferred browser. On Mac, I'm mostly using Brave, but I'm
starting to transition to Safari as I figure out how to customize it to my liking.

# Design Software

## Affinity Photo

**Website:** [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/)

My replacement for Photoshop. It's pretty good, and while my Photoshop muscle memory doesn't translate
perfectly, its buy-once model combined with its feature set makes it the better alternative.

## Affinity Designer

**Website:** [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/)

Same story as Photo, but this one replaces Adobe Illustrator. The one difference is that I reach for
Inkscape when I need to trace raster graphics.

## Affinity Publisher

**Website:** [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/publisher/)

Same story as Photo, but this one replaces Adobe InDesign. It's still new enough to have some issues and
there are features missing, but it works well enough for laying out books and such.

# Development Software

## Visual Studio Code

**Website:** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

After using Nova for over a year, I switched back to VSCode as my editor of choice.

# Hosting and Infrastructure Services

## Namecheap

**Website:** [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

I've heard that other domain registrars are better (e.g., [Hover](https://www.hover.com/)), but I host almost all of my domains
at Namecheap because it works well enough.

## Digital Ocean

**Website:** [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

When I need more than a static site host, I use Digital Ocean.

## Netlify

**Website:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Netlify hosts this website, and a handful of other static sites. It's free and works really well.
