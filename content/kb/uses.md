This is a list of all the things that I use to be productive day-to-day. It's inspired by [this page](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses).

# Hardware

## Alienware Aurora R11

I bought a dedicated gaming PC after I missed gaming too much on my Mac. For a long time I used Windows, but when I "upgraded" to Windows 11, I ran into too many issues and replaced it with Pop_OS! as my sole operating system. However, while most games ran fine in Proton, I ran into a few that had severe problems. One of them would automatically ban your user account if it detected you were using Linux.

So, now I'm on Windows 11. This will change soon once I figure out some logistics issues, and then I'll switch back to Linux.

## 2024 Mac Mini

This is my primary personal computer. I got it late in 2024 after they released the M4 version.

## 2019 MacBook Pro 16"

I replaced my old Windows/Linux custom-built PC with this on July 22nd, 2020. For a time I used it both for development and for gaming, but I missed my favorites too much. Now it's used exclusively for travel.

## Satechi Slim W3 Wired Keyboard

**Website:** [Satechi Slim W3 Wired Keyboard](https://satechi.net/products/satechi-slim-w3-wired-keyboard)

This keyboard is what I use for my Mac Mini. It works well, though I do wish the keys were taller.

## Steelseries Apex Pro Keyboard

**Website:** [Steelseries Apex Pro](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-pro)

This keyboard has a beautiful aesthetic, sturdy construction, and a typefeel that I just adore. It's great for gaming and typing.

## Dell S3220DGF 32" 2K monitor

**Website:** [Dell 32 Curved Gaming Monitor - S3220DGF](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-32-curved-gaming-monitor-s3220dgf/apd/210-atyt/monitors-monitor-accessories)

I replaced my old ultrawidescreen monitor with this. It has a more common aspect ratio, a more stable stand, and much better refresh rate. Besides that, it also "announces" itself properly, meaning that macOS actually recognizes its capabilities. I have three of them - one for my Mac, one for my work Mac, and one for my gaming PC.

## Beautyrest Platinum Sofil Bonded Leather Executive Chair

**Website:** [Beautyrest Platinum Sofil Bonded Leather Executive Chair, Black (49404B)](https://www.staples.com/beautyrest-platinum-sofil-bonded-leather-executive-chair-black-49404b/product_24381184)

I replaced my DXRacer King Zero in March of 2022 with this chair. It's cheaper and more comfortable than the DXRacer was. The cats have already made a number of holes in the faux-leather, though.

## La-Z-Boy Warren Bonded Leather Guest Chair

**Website:** [La-Z-Boy Warren Bonded Leather Guest Chair](https://www.staples.com/la-z-boy-warren-bonded-leather-guest-chair-black-60063s/product_24529902)

I use this for my personal computing space. It's comfortable and looks nice, and was cheap.

# Lifestyle Software

## Firefox

I've changed browsers frequently over the years. Now I seem to have settled on Firefox.

## Spotify

I use Spotify for streaming music and building playlists. If I can't find it on Spotify, I usually need to turn
to self-hosting on Jellyfin.

# Design Software

## Affinity Suite

I switched back to Affinity after not using Adobe for months. The Adobe early termination fee reinforced why I don't want to use Adobe software.

# Development Software

## Zed

**Website:** [Zed](https://zed.dev/)

I'm trying to replace all big tech software with smaller or open-source alternatives. Zed fits the bill so far.

# Hosting and Infrastructure Services

## Porkbun

**Website:** [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)

I'm moving to Porkbun for domain registration. They're cheaper than Namecheap and have a better interface.

## Namecheap

**Website:** [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

I still have a few domains hosted here. It's gotten worse over time.

## Cloudflare

**Website:** [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)

I use Cloudflare for my DNS management. I don't use it as a CDN anymore, though it works well for that purpose.
