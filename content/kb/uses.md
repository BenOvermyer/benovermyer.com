This is a list of all the things that I use to be productive day-to-day.

## Hardware

### Corsair K70 mechanical keyboard

**Website:** [Corsair K70 Lux](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboards/k70-lux-config-na/p/CH-9101020-NA)

I bought this keyboard back in 2013, and it's been my daily workhorse ever since. I use it for gaming, coding, and writing.
The cats don't mind.

## Quality of Life Apps

### Firefox

**Website:** [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/)

This is my web browser of choice. While sometimes I'm forced to use Brave, I try to avoid anything
Chromium-based if I can help it.

## Design

### Affinity Photo

**Website:** [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/)

My replacement for Photoshop. It's pretty good, and while my Photoshop muscle memory doesn't translate
perfectly, its buy-once model combined with its feature set makes it the better alternative.

### Affinity Designer

**Website:** [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/)

Same story as Photo, but this one replaces Adobe Illustrator. The one difference is that I reach for
Inkscape when I need to trace raster graphics.

### Affinity Publisher

**Website:** [Affinity Publisher](https://affinity.serif.com/publisher/)

Same story as Photo, but this one replaces Adobe InDesign. It's still new enough to have some issues and
there are features missing, but it works well enough for laying out books and such.

## Development

### Sublime Text

**Website:** [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Up until recently, I used VS Code for anything that didn't need a dedicated IDE, but was a little too
heavy for just `vim`. However, after getting fed up with some annoying Electron issues, I decided to
try Sublime Text again. It had been about half a decade since I last tried it out, but oh man, is it
_fast_. I've now uninstalled VS Code everywhere and use this instead.

### GoLand

**Website:** [Jetbrains GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/)

I write a lot of Go. And by far the best tool for writing Go has been GoLand.

## Hosting

### Namecheap

**Website:** [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

I've heard that other domain registrars are better (e.g., Hover), but I host almost all of my domains
at Namecheap because it works well enough.

### Digital Ocean

**Website:** [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

Digital Ocean is the infrastructure provider I use for all of my personal projects. It's cheaper than
AWS, Azure, or GCP, the tooling is really good, and the community is fantastic.

### Netlify

**Website:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Netlify hosts this website, and a handful of other static sites. It's free and works really well.
