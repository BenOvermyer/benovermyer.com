This is my page about wines I like and things I've learned about wine.

# Excellent Wines

- **1924 Limited Edition (2018):** bourbon barrel aged cabernet sauvignon, out of Lodi, California. A product of Gnarly Head Wines.

# Excellent Wine Importers

- [Kermit Lynch](https://kermitlynch.com): Very into the Old World wines, esp. French. Was knighted by France.

# On Judging Wine

On the label, look for the following things:

- ABV between 11-13%
- A regulatory body, if from an Old World country
- An importer, if from a foreign country
- Whether they list the grape type and the region or not
