These are notes regarding the fabrication of costume armor.

# Foam Materials

Buy foam floor tiles and use that. It's really cheap.

# Pattern Practices

## Registration Marks

When marking out a pattern onto foam or whatever material you're using, draw registration marks on the material so that it's easier to glue the pieces together.

## Pattern Material

Use posterboard or card stock for patterns so you can reuse them often.

# Adhesive

Apparently "barge cement" is an industry standard for fabricating things like this.

Apply to both sides very lightly and allow to set just a little bit so it's tacky. Then press together.

If making a concave piece, invert the piece after gluing the seams. This will make the adhesive join tighter.

# Battle Damage

Use a woodburning tool to make "cuts" and other small details for battle damage in foam armor.
