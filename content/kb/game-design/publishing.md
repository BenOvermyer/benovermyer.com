## Regarding SKUs

SKUs for tabletop games should be three letters followed by five numbers.

The three letters should represent your company. Register your prefix at [the Hobby Manufacturers Association](https://hobbysmc.com/) website.

The five numbers should follow a logical scheme based on product lines. When sorting by SKU, product lines should be listed together.
