These are things that I have found useful or interesting, or
spend a large amount of time on.

## Command Line Tools

* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): Useful for having multiple workflows in progress on a Linux server or workstation at once.
* [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/): I use this to create recordings of shell sessions to demonstrate things to people.

## Automation Tools

* [drone](https://drone.io): CI/CD tool, in the vein of Jenkins but far better.
* [Ansible](https://ansible.com): My orchestration management tool of choice.
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io): Infrastructure-as-code. A vital part of my server automation.

## Self-Hosted Applications

* [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/): GitHub clone.
* [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/): RSS reader, like Google Reader.
* [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/): Federated blog software. Written in Go.
