The following is a glossary of math symbols. I wrote it as part of my early grad studies in software engineering. It's meant to assist me in understanding discrete mathematics.

## The Glossary

### The easy ones

**Addition:** $+$

**Subtraction:** $-$

**Multiplication:** $\times$

**Division:** $\div$

**Square Root:** $\sqrt{x}$

### Set Theory

**Empty Set:** $\emptyset$

**Union:** $\cup$ (a union is the result of combining two sets)

**Intersection:** $\cap$ (an intersection is the result of finding common elements between two sets)

**Difference:** $\setminus$ (a difference is the result of removing elements from one set that are also in another set, for example $A \setminus B$)

**Symmetric Difference:** $\Delta$ (a symmetric difference is the result of combining the differences between two sets)

**Set Membership:** $\in$ (an element is a member of a set, for example $x \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. Read as "x is an element of the set {1, 2, 3}")

**Set Non-Membership:** $\notin$ (an element is not a member of a set)

### Basic Logic

**Negation:** $\neg$ (a negation is the opposite of a statement, for example $\neg P$)

**Conjunction:** $\land$ (a conjunction is the result of combining two statements with "and", for example $P \land Q$)

**Disjunction:** $\lor$ (a disjunction is the result of combining two statements with "or", for example $P \lor Q$)

**Implication:** $\implies$ (an implication is the result of combining two statements with "if...then", for example $P \implies Q$)

**Biconditional:** $\iff$ (a biconditional is the result of combining two statements with "if and only if", for example $P \iff Q$)

**Equivalence:** $\equiv$ (an equivalence is the result of combining two statements with "is equivalent to", for example $P \equiv Q$)

**Existential Qualification:** $\exists$ (an existential qualification is the result of combining a statement with "there exists", for example $\exists x \in \mathbb{R}$)

**Universal Qualification:** $\forall$ (a universal qualification is the result of combining a statement with "for all", for example $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$)

**Uniqueness Qualification:** $\exists!$ (a uniqueness qualification is the result of combining a statement with "there exists exactly one", for example $\exists! x \in \mathbb{R}$)

### Blackboard Bold

Letters in the "blackboard bold" font are used to denote mathematical sets and numbers.

**Natural Numbers:** $\mathbb{N}$

**Integers:** $\mathbb{Z}$

**Rational Numbers:** $\mathbb{Q}$

**Real Numbers:** $\mathbb{R}$

**Complex Numbers:** $\mathbb{C}$
