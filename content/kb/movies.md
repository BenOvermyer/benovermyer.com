Sometimes someone will tell me about a movie I need to see. Usually, my response is "cool, I'll add it to the list." Before adding this page to my site, that meant I'd add it to my mental list of movies to watch. Relying on memory is problematic at best, so I decided to create an actual list on my site to track everything that's in that queue.

# Movies to Watch

This is the main list. If I get recommendations, or see a movie I want to watch, it goes here.

- Anna
- Bringing Up Baby
- High&Low
- Iron Mask
- Kung Fu Panda 4
- The Bricklayer
- The China Syndrome
- The Hill
- The Liberator

# Swashbuckling Movies

At some point I put together this list because I was playing a character in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign that was a swashbuckler-type. The list took a bit of effort to put together, so I didn't want to just scrap it after I left that campaign.

- Robin Hood, Errol Flynn
- The Mark of Zorro, Tyrone Power
- The Sea Hawk, Errol Flynn
- Scaramouche, Janet Leigh
- The Mask of Zorro, Catherine Zeta-Jones
- Adventures of Don Juan, Errol Flynn
- The Three Musketeers, Raquel Welch
- The Master of Ballantrae, Errol Flynn
- The Scarlet Pimpernel, Merle Oberon
- The Crimson Pirate, Christopher Lee
- The Prince and the Pauper, Errol Flynn
- Rob Roy, Liam Neeson
- The Scarlet Pimpernel, Ian McKellan
- Ivanhoe, Elizabeth Taylor
- The Prisoner of Zenda, David Niven
- Treasure Island, Lionel Barrymore
