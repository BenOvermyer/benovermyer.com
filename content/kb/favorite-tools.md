These are things that I have found useful or interesting, or spend a large amount of time on.

## Command Line Tools

* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): Useful for having multiple workflows in progress on a Linux server or workstation at once.
* [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/): I use this to create recordings of shell sessions to demonstrate things to people.
* [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn): Manuscripts I write are all done in LaTeX these days. It's wonderful for marrying writing and layout in one format.

## Automation Tools

* [drone](https://drone.io): CI/CD tool, in the vein of Jenkins but far better.
* [Ansible](https://ansible.com): My previous orchestration management tool of choice. I still use it for small things.
* [Chef](https://chef.io): This is now the orchestration management tool I reach for first, thanks to its robust DSL.
* [Terraform](https://terraform.io): Infrastructure-as-code. A vital part of my server automation.

## Self-Hosted Applications

* [FreshRSS](https://www.freshrss.org/): RSS reader, like Google Reader.
* [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/): Federated blog software. Written in Go.
