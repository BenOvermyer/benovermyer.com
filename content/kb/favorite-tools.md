These are things that I have found useful or interesting, or spend a large amount of time on.

# Command Line Tools

- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): Useful for having multiple workflows in progress on a Linux server or workstation at once.
- [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/): I use this to create recordings of shell sessions to demonstrate things to people.
- [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn): Manuscripts I write are all done in LaTeX these days. It's wonderful for marrying writing and layout in one format.

# Automation Tools

- [drone](https://drone.io): CI/CD tool, in the vein of Jenkins but far better.
- [Ansible](https://ansible.com): My previous orchestration management tool of choice. I still use it for small things.
- [Chef](https://chef.io): This is now the orchestration management tool I reach for first, thanks to its robust DSL and lack of Red Hat infection.
- [Terraform](https://terraform.io): Infrastructure-as-code. Previously a vital part of my personal infrastructure automation.
- [Pulumi](https://pulumi.io): Another infrastructure-as-code tool, and one I prefer over Terraform because of the use of a full language.

# Self-Hosted Applications

- [IT-Tools](https://github.com/CorentinTh/it-tools): A collection of small utilities all in one app. Very handy.
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/): A media player; I use it for streaming MP3s.
- [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/): RSS reader, very lightweight.
- [Paperless](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/): A document organizer.
- [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/): Federated blog software. Written in Go.
