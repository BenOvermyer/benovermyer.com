## Sounds and their English written forms

I'm writing this to use as reference for a language generator. The
following are unusual characters that can be used to represent
specific sounds.

- ʧ: "ch" like in "church"
- θ: "th" like in "thing"
- ð: "th" like in "this"
- ʃ: "sh" like in "she"
- ʒ: "zh" like in "seizure"
- ŋ: "ng" like in "sing"

Otherwise, everything can be represented more-or-less with standard English
letters. Wikipedia has a page with [IPA charts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart_for_English_dialects) for further
information.

## Components of a Language

**Phonology:** The sound system of a language

**Syntax:** The set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language, including word order

**Morphology:** The structure of words and parts of words, including stems, root words, and affixes

**Vocabulary:** A set of words within a language

**Orthography:** The written form of language

## Definitions

**Phoneme:** A unit of sound that can distinguish one word from another in a particular language.

**Morpheme:** The minimal meaningful unit of a language.

**Lexeme:** A singular concept expressed as a word.

## Lexeme vs. word-form

In morphology, lexeme and word-form are two separate but related concepts that define a "word." As
an example:

The lexeme *eat* contains the word-forms *eat*, *eats*, *eaten*, and *ate*. The lexemes *eat* and *eater*
are different concepts - one is a verb and the other a noun.

## Inflection vs. word formation

Inflectional rules relate to different forms of the same lexeme - e.g., tense changes. Word formation rules
relate to new lexemes derived from other lexemes - e.g., dishwasher from dish.
