## Regarding this Page

About pages by definition are very self-centered. Their whole purpose is to let the author talk about him/herself. Given that, I am not going to pull any punches or be diplomatic in my declarations. No apologies. I'm not trying to sell myself here; I'm trying to give you an idea of who I am. Oh, and before you ask, yes, I'm a Millennial...barely.

## Professional Background

I'm a software engineer who loves the web. Not just web technology, mind you; the very idea of the web. Over the last twenty years, it has changed the world. It's my job and my passion to make it better.

I have travelled the world, lived abroad, and usually only ever lived in one place for a couple years. That changed when I moved to Minneapolis. Of all the places I've lived on this globe, Minneapolis has been my favorite. It helps that Minneapolis is turning into a tech hub with a wealth of interesting people doing interesting things with the web.

My particular focus in the professional world is DevOps. I love the idea of melding together operations and development into a kind of superdiscipline. Even better is how the philosophy of DevOps helps people help each other.

I started my professional career as a developer, not a system administrator. Now I'm an operations manager, and I love being able to help people make awesome things together.
