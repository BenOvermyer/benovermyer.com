I'm a software engineer who loves the web. Not just web technology, mind you; the very idea of the web. Over the last twenty years, it has changed the world. It's my job and my passion to make it better.

I have travelled the world, lived abroad, and usually only ever lived in one place for a couple years. That changed when I moved to Minneapolis. Of all the places I've lived on this globe, Minneapolis has been my favorite.

It helps that Minneapolis is turning into a tech hub with a wealth of interesting people doing interesting things with the web.

My particular focus in the world of the web is in DevOps. I love the idea of melding together operations and development into a kind of superdiscipline. Even better is how the philosophy of DevOps helps people help each other.

I started my professional career as a developer, not a system administrator. Now I'm an operations manager. What a long, strange trip it's been.
