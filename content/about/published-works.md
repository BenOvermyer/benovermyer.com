Over the years I’ve released a variety of books, articles, and other documents into the wild. Some of these were published in the true print sense, and some were only released online.

These are listed in reverse chronological order. Where possible, I included a link to the most recent publicly available version. I’ve only listed those works where I was the sole or primary author.
