						Hi, I'm Ben. I love making web experiences awesome for people and machines.
					</p>
					<p>
						By day, I work as a DevOps consultant. My time is spent helping organizations up their operations game.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time I work on procedural content generation tools for tabletop role-playing games. You can see my
						latest works in this area at <a href="https://ironarachne.com">Iron Arachne</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I spend a lot of time thinking about how to encourage people of wildly different worldviews to talk to each
						other instead of yelling at each other.
