                Hi, I'm Ben. I love making web experiences awesome for people and machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                By day, I work as a DevOps consultant. My time is spent helping organizations up their web operations
                game.

            <p>
                In my free time I work on procedural content generation tools for tabletop role-playing games. You can
                see my
                latest works in this area at <a href="https://ironarachne.com">Iron Arachne</a>.

            <p>
                I spend a lot of time thinking about how to encourage people of wildly different worldviews to talk to
                each
                other instead of yelling at each other.
